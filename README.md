# Finding topic clusers in tech news: using unsupervized learning to cluster news articles based on content

*python | webscraping | natural language processing*

# Intro

It started in July 2019, when I stumbled the phrase that AI poses “an existential threat” to humanity. I didn’t know what that meant at the time: a threat to human existence. For some reason, I found that claim to be satisfyingly bold, and I wanted to know more. Embarking into a clickhole typical of my obsessive nature, I subscribed to some news sites on AI and started reading way more tech news.

A significant portion of the news I scanned for topics that jumped out at me or seemed interesting at first glance. The problem is that I still felt like my understanding of these topics was too superficial to know if I was clicking on the articles that are the best use of my time, or if I was missing a topic or theme altogether. 

While tags can be helpful to get a sense of an article outside of the title, many of them seem to reference vague, poorly defined or refined terms.  Rather than relying on these tags, I wanted to see if unsupervised learning could help me identify themes or groups of themes to assist in my reading. 

## Dataset

#### This repository is the first iteration of this project: getting data.

By selecting news from sites that don’t specifically focus on tech or science news,I hoped that this idea could be generalized to other vague or broad news topics. 

# Project goals

I am aiming to find clusters in tech news articles based on the full content of the article. I also hope to use the content to find themes or constructs that can summarize the clusters.
