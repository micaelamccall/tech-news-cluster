Adam Liptak,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether Google should have to pay Oracle billions of dollars in a long-running copyright infringement lawsuit over software used to run many of the world’s smartphones. In a brief urging the Supreme Court to hear its appeal , Google called the dispute “the copyright case of the decade.” Oracle asked for $9 billion in damages over what it said was Google’s wrongful copying of about 11,000 lines of software code in Android, its mobile phone operating system. In 2016, a San Francisco jury found that Google had not violated copyright laws because it had made “fair use” of the code. But last year a specialized appeals court in Washington, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, disagreed with that assessment and sent the case back for a trial to determine how much Google must pay in damages. The case, Google v. Oracle America , No. 18-956, concerns Google’s reliance on aspects of Java, an open-source software language, in the Android operating system. Oracle, which acquired Java in 2010 when it bought Sun Microsystems, said that using parts of it without permission amounted to copyright infringement. Google responded that free access to the software interfaces in question were crucial to the innovation economy. “Without interfaces,” Google lawyers wrote in a Supreme Court brief , “your contact list cannot access your email program, which cannot send a message using the operating system, which cannot access your phone in the first place. Each is an island.” In its own brief , Oracle said that robust copyright protections made innovation possible. “Google’s theory is that, having invested all those resources to create a program popular with platform developers and app programmers alike, Oracle should be required to let a competitor copy its code so that it can co-opt the fan base to create its own best-selling sequel,” Oracle’s lawyers wrote. “The next Oracle will think twice about investing as heavily in a venture like Java if it knows that any competitor could freely copy its work to compete directly against it.” The Trump administration had urged the justices to side with Oracle and deny review . Conceding that the appeals court’s ruling on fair use was “not free from doubt,” the administration said that on balance the Federal Circuit had gotten it right. Google “copied 11,500 lines of computer code verbatim, as well as the complex structure and organization inherent in that code, in order to help its competing commercial product,” Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco wrote, adding that Google’s “unauthorized copying harmed the market for respondent’s Java platform.”","Nov. 15, 2019",New York Times,NA,Supreme Court to Hear Google and Oracle Copyright Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/us/supreme-court-google-oracle.html
Yiren Lu,"The HeyTea shop  in the Chaoyang district of Beijing is an expression of svelte minimalism, its LED lettering and black tiles giving off a vaguely retro vibe. On a recent weekend, one of the last truly warm days of early fall, the location was full of upmarket customers — families with strollers, Gen Z-ers in knockoff Supreme streetwear — enjoying the popular cheese tea. On the front facade, right by the door, an illustration of a hand holding a phone displayed a two-dimensional bar code, or QR code. “Scan the code to avoid lines,” a sign read. The scene was far removed from the days 18 months earlier, when HeyTea, one of the hottest brands in China, was infamous for its long lines. Stories on WeChat, the ubiquitous Chinese social media and messaging app, of customers waiting two, three, four hours for a cup of tea only served to stoke greater demand. “I think that curiosity, the desire to wait in line because everyone else is doing it, it speaks to something fundamental in human nature,” says Peilin Chan, HeyTea’s chief technology officer. Yet as much as the shop had benefited from the viral marketing, Chan knew it was also unsustainable if HeyTea wanted to become anything more than a pop-culture gimmick. Customers were hiring people to stand in line for them (a practice known as daigou, or ‘“substitute buying”). Long delivery times were spoiling the quality of its teas. Complaints were starting to flood in online. To solve the problem, Chan turned to the same platform that made it too big to live with. In early 2017, WeChat announced a new feature called miniprograms. Such apps are part of WeChat and don’t need to be downloaded, allowing anyone to set up a digital storefront within WeChat. Chan could have created a regular mobile app, but the integration with WeChat Pay, the platform’s mobile payment service, made billing easy, and most important, customers were already there. “At the time, we just thought that the miniprogram provided a pretty good user experience,” Chan says. The resulting miniprogram, called HeyTea Go, is opened by scanning a QR code and lets customers place orders without having to stand in line. Simultaneously, it created technological opportunities for the company, like online marketing and the collection of data about its patrons. Chan describes the adoption of the platform as — in what has been the case for hundreds of thousands of other businesses in China — “the starting point of our digital transformation.” This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. [Read about paying for a “luxury internet.”] Slim and energetic, with the pompadour of a Korean boy-bander, Chan was born in Guangdong, part of a post-’90s generation of Chinese kids who grew up as China was transitioning from pre- to post-internet society. In 2008, the year Chan went off to college, if you ordered something online, he says, the courier would hand over your purchase, and you would hand over a wad of cash. Download speeds were slow across the country, and few people in smaller, remote cities had access to the internet. Over the next decade, Chan watched as his country went through a digital transformation as impressive as the construction boom that filled its urban skylines. E-commerce exploded. Mobile payment apps made cash obsolete. One app in particular would come to dominate Chan’s life: WeChat. Developed by Tencent, a social media giant, WeChat got its start as a chat app before evolving into a superapp. Today it has more than a billion monthly active users and — according to a 2018 report by WalktheChat , a WeChat marketing company — hosts roughly 34 percent of all Chinese data traffic. It is a social network, a payments system, a communication medium and, perhaps most ambitious, the infrastructure for businesses like HeyTea. WeChat’s first foray into this marketplace came in 2012, with the introduction of “official accounts,” which resemble Facebook Pages. In early 2017, it introduced miniprograms. In the two years since then, businesses have created more than a million of them, equal to half the number of iOS apps available in Apple’s App Store. They come from global conglomerates like McDonald’s and Tesla and from local businesses like restaurants, hair salons and gyms. All of them are drawn in by the gravitational pull of WeChat’s enormous number of users and its standardized software infrastructure. It resembles the European Union in the way it has evolved into a market ecosystem: Miniprogram developers benefit from a common currency (WeChat’s mobile payment system), an identification system (WeChat’s login and password) and greatly lowered barriers to trade and movement (easy integration with any number of other services on WeChat). Because miniprograms run inside WeChat, businesses’ customers don’t have to sign up, log in or add their credit card numbers. Offline businesses looking to move online have long faced a list of challenges like payment processing and analytics. Small- and medium-size businesses in particular have struggled against ambitious tech behemoths like Amazon. But with miniprograms, some of the biggest beneficiaries are local businesses that depend on foot traffic. By scanning a QR code, customers beam details about their physical situation — I’m at a HeyTea and drinking this particular cheese tea — back to the miniprogram. Such data, which connect users’ offline behavior with their online profiles, can then help drive product decisions. In HeyTea’s case, the miniprogram gave the company access to information about the popularity of tea flavors and customer churn. By targeting new teas appropriately and cutting down on lines, HeyTea was able to “level up” in a way that a similar-size business in the United States would have had a tough time doing: Within six months of the debut of HeyTea Go, it tripled the rate at which repeat customers bought drinks. Miniprograms aren’t do-everything miracles, of course — they languish without good marketing, can be slow and still require development resources. They also tie the businesses tightly to WeChat, which may eventually work against their financial and strategic interests. But their success in China provides a fascinating look into an alternative vision of the mobile internet, one that is integrated across multiple dimensions and that is in essence a single large market. What sorts of innovations does that engender? What sorts of tensions does that create? Is it a better architecture than our Western one, in which each business has its own mobile app, existing in isolation, downloaded but idle for large chunks of the day? The longstanding consensus about the Chinese internet is that it “decoupled” from the rest of the world 10 years ago, and that for every American tech company there is an equivalent in China. While this is largely true for applications used by consumers — the ride-sharing apps and search engines and social media sites — in reality, the two internets have yet to fully disengage from each other. Android, made by Google, and iOS, made by Apple, are still the two dominant mobile operating systems in China. Programming frameworks like React (made by Facebook) and languages like Java and Python have been adopted enthusiastically by Chinese developers. Until now, this kind of infrastructural innovation has flowed mostly from the West to China. While the first generation of Chinese tech giants, known as BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent), were founded during the desktop internet era, the mobile internet gave rise to a new triumvirate, TMD (Toutiao, Meituan Dianping and Didi Chuxing). In recent years these and other mobile companies have revolutionized every aspect of Chinese life. Many have even grown, octopuslike, to encompass several sectors at once. Here are some of China’s top apps, arrayed by function. WECHAT The Chinese superapp that incorporates social media, payment, messaging and e-commerce functionalities and that has given rise to a million hosted miniapps. DEDAO A podcasting app that provides paying users with access to a library of podcasts and columns by well-known professors and industry experts. TAOBAO An e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba. Small businesses can set up a storefront on Taobao, which facilitates payments and consumer-to-consumer messaging. PINDUODUO A group-shopping app that allows users to gather friends to make bulk online purchases. DOUYIN/TIKTOK The short-form video app that is set to become one of the most popular apps in the world. JINRI TOUTIAO A machine-learning-driven news-aggregation app developed by ByteDance. VIPKID An education start-up that matches Chinese students with native English speakers abroad for one-to-one English tutoring over video conference. DIDI CHUXING The main Chinese ride-hailing app, formed from a merger between the previous two leaders, Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, and the acquisition of Uber China. MOBIKE/OFO Dockless bike-sharing apps that sprang up in 2014 and 2015 and collectively unleashed millions of bikes on the country over the next few years. ALIPAY A mobile-payment app developed by Alibaba; the main competition in China to WeChat Pay. XIAOHONGSHU A social media and e-commerce platform that allows users and social media influencers to post product reviews and lifestyle content. The so-called WeChat model may be the first time things are going in reverse. Even as the tensions between China and the United States remain strained, with much of the antagonism focused on intellectual property in technology, American tech companies have found in the WeChat internet a lot to admire — and emulate. In 2017, Google introduced “Instant Apps,” and last year Instagram unveiled shopping and payments initiatives. Mark Zuckerberg’s directive earlier this year to integrate Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram suggests superapplike ambitions. Given the political environment in the West, with big tech facing regulatory and antitrust scrutiny, the WeChat model is unlikely to be imported wholesale. But elements of its design are sure to show up in the West. Whether because of the appeal of mobile payments, or its use of QR codes, or the sheer convenience of not having to keep track of your 100th password, the WeChat model offers some undeniable improvements. The age of the mobile internet dawned in 2008 with the opening of the Apple App Store and has lasted more than a decade; the WeChat internet is almost certainly a glimpse of what comes next. If you’re a  30-year-old office worker living in a smaller city in China today, your day might go something like this: You wake up in the morning and check your mobile phone, possibly an iPhone but more likely a late-model Xiaomi or Huawei Android that nevertheless has all the latest camera filters. You scroll through the Facebook News Feed-like Moments feature on WeChat and post a couple messages to the WeChat group chats you belong to. For breakfast, you get a jianbing, or crepe, from the vendor downstairs, and you pay with WeChat Pay. On your commute to work you check out Jinri Toutiao, an A.I.-driven news-aggregation app that recommends several articles on how to combat your acid reflux. That reminds you that you should probably see the doctor, a process that used to involve a full day of running around the hospital and waiting in lines (a familiar routine known as guahao ) and then paying for prescriptions. Luckily, you can now get through all that virtually on WeChat, and even pay your medical bill there. Finally, you get to work. The job is in sales for a midsize manufacturer, and because there’s no real separation between work life and personal life in China, and because no one uses email, all your communication with clients takes place over WeChat. On your break you swipe through Kuaishou, a short-video app, and check Weibo, the Chinese Twitter. You pay your utilities bill on WeChat and book train tickets through the China Railway miniprogram so you can go home to visit your parents for the new year. You see that a neighbor has sent your apartment complex’s WeChat group the link to a special deal on imported soy sauce — 70 percent off! — available on Pinduoduo , a social e-commerce app that offers deep discounts on bulk purchases that you split with your friends. (You go in on the deal.) After work, you go to dinner at a restaurant in the neighborhood, where you order using the restaurant’s miniprogram. When you get home, you read some new posts from your favorite “key opinion leaders” on WeChat, then are suckered into buying a zit-zapping machine on Taobao. You check the number of steps you walked today using the WeRun app before getting in bed. (Fewer than 10,000, alas.) To spend any amount of time in China today is to understand why it’s said that people “live on WeChat” — but when it was first founded in 2011, in Guangzhou, WeChat was just a messaging app. “The country was really lacking one standard communication platform, which in the U.S., I think, is still email,” says Connie Chan, a general partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. “WeChat was something that was built for mobile specifically,” she says. “It wasn’t just taking a P.C. platform and moving it to mobile — and as a result you saw a number of mobile-friendly features from very early days: the QR code, the voice message.” WeChat grew slowly at first, and then explosively. Its early days coincided with a major demographic shift in Chinese internet users: As the price of a smartphone in China dropped significantly this decade, internet access became available to hundreds of millions of laobaixing, or ordinary folks, in China’s interior. For many of these users, the mobile phone was their introduction to the internet. Unused to downloading other apps, they spent almost all their online time on WeChat, posting photos to Moments and chatting with their friends. Then, in 2012, the introduction of gongzhong hao, or official accounts, brought businesses and media personalities into the mix. For Chinese consumers, official accounts meant that spending time on WeChat was no longer simply a leisure diversion; the platform was also a place for commerce. Official accounts allowed Chinese business to leapfrog, technologically speaking, the traditional website, putting customers within reach of a direct message. The final ingredient would come during the Chinese New Year in 2014, when WeChat introduced a virtual “red envelope” that could be sent to friends. This internet-age update on the Chinese tradition of gifting hongbao full of cash to family and friends transcended the holiday to become a full-fledged mobile payment service, WeChat Pay. The subsequent competition between WeChat Pay and Alibaba’s Alipay precipitated China’s transformation into a cashless society. By scanning a QR code either displayed on a phone or printed on a piece of paper, customers could now pay merchants without cash or a credit card. Having secured the two foundational needs of any digital society — identity and payments — the WeChat ecosystem flourished throughout the mid-2010s. Businesses like Air China expanded their official accounts into de facto websites. Fashion bloggers and writers made money from whatever they posted on their official accounts through donation buttons, which were plugged into WeChat Pay. While it was long-accepted wisdom in Silicon Valley that internet consumers would not pay for content, it turns out that when you make it easy for readers to make payments in small sums, they will . In WeChat’s early years, the government allowed it to grow essentially unfettered; unlike in the United States, which is coming to see big tech as a colossus that needs to be knocked down, the Chinese government saw tech companies as economic engines to be harnessed. “In the U.S., as a politician, you answer to citizens, so you want to work on issues that get you the most number of votes,” says Yuechen Zhao, a partner at GSR Ventures. “In China, you answer to the level above you, and because there’s this huge push for tech, there’s a lot more incentive for officials to look at how they can integrate tech into their city or how they can integrate tech into public services.” As WeChat grew, it made more and more sense for various public health care, education and transportation services to piggyback on the platform, either as official accounts or miniprograms. And in the Chinese political system, where a state directive can cut through the protests of any particular corporation or individual, implementation was more straightforward. The result — a deeply integrated and extremely useful WeChat internet — is one that is difficult to imagine in a democratic West. In February, I  met with Sergi de Pablo Quesada, a Barcelona-born expat who runs a miniprogram-development venture called Out1N, in Shanghai. Unlike HeyTea, most small- and medium-size businesses don’t have the engineering resources to build their own miniprograms. Instead, they contract the making of a miniprogram to a third party, which typically charges around $2,000 or $3,000. De Pablo Quesada, 30, isn’t an engineer by background, but he coded several of his own mobile apps before starting Out1N. What he discovered was that miniprograms are at once analogous to and yet fundamentally different from native mobile apps. Native applications, like most of the apps used in the United States, are built directly on the mobile operating system (iOS or Android), which is the layer of software that interfaces with the hardware. WeChat miniprograms, on the other hand, are built on top of WeChat, an application itself built on top of the operating system. As Apple does with its iOS operating system, WeChat provides a bundle of coding tools known as a software developer’s kit, or S.D.K., which helps programmers develop applications for specific platforms. These tools will typically include a code editor, which is sort of like Microsoft Word for programmers (it’s where the code itself is written); a compiler, which translates the human-readable code to machine-readable assembly language; and an emulator, which shows what the application will look like to the end user. The S.D.K. also provides a set of hooks, called an application programming interface (A.P.I.), that connect a miniprogram to WeChat’s payments and login infrastructure. So if you’re a third-party developer — say, HeyTea — you can download the WeChat S.D.K. onto your computer, launch the editor, have your software engineers write the code to run your miniprogram, compile it, visualize it, rinse and repeat. When the miniprogram has been completed, the developer sends the entire miniprogram to WeChat for approval. Aside from some differences in coding languages and procedures, the process resembles that of making a regular app. But being a level removed from the operating system yields some benefits: Miniprogram developers do not have to make something for both iOS and Android, or decide between the two; they can just work with WeChat. Instead of having to figure out which of the top 10 Android stores to publish to — Google’s exit from China in 2010 created an enormous vacuum that was filled by hundreds of different app stores, set up by phone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi, carriers like China Mobile and tech giants like Baidu and Tencent — you can just publish to WeChat. If you imagine the miniprogram as a painting, then WeChat provides canvas, brushes and wall space. It does not provide promotion. “Not every business that wants to sell through miniprograms succeeds,” de Pablo Quesada says. The ones that do typically rely on marketing by influencers or brick-and-mortar stores, like HeyTea, that can publicize their online services. Because there isn’t an official miniprogram store, getting exposure for one is a challenge. Nevertheless, de Pablo Quesada says that his business is booming. He has built miniprograms for, among others, clients who need to automatically generate price quotes as well as for retailers like popular bakeries. Last April, in Shanghai, I met Wang Guanchun, the 35-year-old chief executive of Laiye, the maker of A.I.-powered virtual assistants, including Xiaolai, which is available as both an official account and a miniprogram on WeChat. He started the company in 2015 when he noticed that traditional services like financial management and real estate, and not just ride-sharing and food delivery, were increasingly moving online within WeChat. “In this kind of environment, a virtual assistant would be able to expand beyond just random conversation, or a simple search,” he told me. It would be able to complete actual tasks for users. While Xiaolai shares similarities with Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant, its work is easier, in some ways. Alexa and Assistant struggle to take action in the physical world — book a taxi, order food, make a restaurant reservation or doctor’s appointment. Every one of these “skills” has an existing incumbent (Uber, Zocdoc) with which a virtual assistant needs to be integrated. I can ask Xiaolai, on the other hand, to book plane tickets to Nanjing on June 3, and it will directly conduct a search on Air China’s WeChat miniprogram, confirm the timetables and make the purchase with WeChat Pay. Contrast this setup with Google’s Duplex, a conversational A.I. that was released to great fanfare last year. Duplex is an impressive feat of text-to-speech machine learning, an A.I. that can carry on real-time phone calls with a human on the other end being none the wiser. But in China, there wouldn’t be a human on the other end; there would be a WeChat miniprogram. When Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, introduced Duplex, he noted that 60 percent of small businesses in the United States still didn’t have an online booking system. Duplex, in other words, is predicated on the inevitability of phone calls. Xiaolai is predicated on their obsolescence. The WeChat marketplace  is not without its drawbacks. A perennial debate in tech has raged over the benefits and costs of consolidation. When I talk to businesses that are developing WeChat miniprograms, they acknowledge that the platform is feudalistic, binding them ever closer to Tencent, at the expense of their own independence. “But what can we do about it?” HeyTea’s Chan asks, pointing out that traditional mobile apps, too, are built on real estate owned by tech giants — the operating system. Even in the West, the trend in recent years has been toward fewer large companies. Leveraging their size, their cash reserves, their ability to attract the best engineering talent and make innovations deeper in the computing stack, the breadth and depth of their user bases and product offerings, they’ve made incursions further and further afield. In the mobile internet in particular, the tollbooth operators are Apple and Google. The two companies have the power to accept or decline submissions to their respective app stores — and more subtly, by publishing the S.D.K.s, they control the technical specifications of the mobile apps themselves. With miniprograms, WeChat assumes a similar role: Developers are now designing miniprograms that fulfill WeChat’s requirements and that are subject to its approval. It has the power and privilege to police who gets access to a billion customers. While WeChat hasn’t thus far shown the tendency to block or shut down miniprograms without cause, it’s easy to envision a future in which WeChat looks to squeeze money from the enormous marketplace it has built and begins taking a cut of every miniprogram transaction. That would make it like the Apple and Android app stores, which keep 30 percent of first-year revenues from paid apps. At that point, businesses that had spent years building up traffic to their miniprograms would have little recourse. The more prescient miniprogram users today, then, like HeyTea, often see miniprograms as training wheels for their own apps. The connected WeChat internet also brings a unique set of privacy and security issues. Christopher Balding, a former professor of economics at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen, cites examples of businesses selling on the black market customers’ personal information gleaned from WeChat. “A lot of stores, if you scan the QR code, it just starts sucking up enormous amounts of data,” he said, “You could probably go to a corner shop that sells noodles and say, Hey, I want to buy some data.” Some of this data will end up in the hands of internet fraudsters. Given various official data-privacy crackdowns currently going on, a lot of it will also end up captured by the government’s own surveillance efforts. As WeChat has grown, the government has developed increasingly sophisticated techniques to use it as a way to pry into citizens’ private lives while also muzzling its potential as a political town hall. New regulations issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China in September 2017, for instance, hold WeChat chat group administrators liable for politically sensitive or pornographic messages in the groups they manage — in effect creating a system of grass-roots censorship. “They can control WeChat without having to kill it,” says Bill Bishop, a well-known China analyst, adding, “That’s what’s so fascinating — the regulators are really smart.” The dark side of the WeChat internet is that all the factors that have made it such a vibrant ecosystem — the identity and payments data, the user engagement — also make it an incredibly dangerous tool. Mobile payments provide an easily traceable financial trail; China’s incipient “social credit” scoring system may end up analyzing users’ payment records and online activity in order to determine eligibility for various social and financial services. As the Chinese internet becomes the WeChat internet, WeChat will increasingly be treated as a public utility, subject to more and more direct interference. This is the cost that Chinese companies have always paid, but the WeChat internet arguably exacerbates it: By consolidating user activity that was previously divided among different online sites, or conducted offline, onto a single platform and onto miniprograms, they’ve made users even easier pickings. In Shanghai this fall, I met with Thibault Genaitay, the 30-year-old head of China operations at Le Wagon, a French-founded coding boot camp with three locations in the country. Two years ago, at the very beginning of the miniprogram era, Le Wagon began investing in the miniprogram ecosystem — testing its coding framework and adding miniprogram-focused lectures to its courses. Today many of its alumni are miniprogram developers helping foreign brands expand their WeChat presence, and Le Wagon finds itself liaising between an international market eager to access WeChat’s audience and a WeChat with increasingly international ambitions. “Tencent is pushing very hard for miniprograms to have traction abroad,” Genaitay told me. “They’re hosting hackathons in Singapore and Europe. They want to have third-party providers working in conjunction with merchants to develop miniprograms, mainly for Chinese consumers abroad.” He added, “We’re talking about the diaspora of millions of WeChat users outside of China, that’s their first angle.” In many ways, it’s an inopportune time for an international expansion by a Chinese company. United States-China relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War. Technology has become tinged by nationalism. The shaky détente between Apple and WeChat — miniprograms cut out the Apple App Store and make WeChat the only app you need on your phone — is unlikely to hold forever, and as has happened to Huawei, strategic and political currents will probably end up forcing Tencent onto its own operating system. Yet in other ways, the time is finally right. In 2013, when it tried to expand internationally, WeChat lost out to WhatsApp, a messaging app with similar functionality but perhaps greater cultural appeal. Today, though, WeChat is no longer just a messaging app: It’s also the world’s biggest marketplace. For foreign companies that want to sell their products to Chinese consumers, miniprograms offer a shortcut through an otherwise byzantine array of middlemen, distributors and import partners. As de Pablo Quesada puts it: “It gives small businesses the opportunity to not only sell to Chinese tourists when they are in New York City, but then to be able to sustain the relationship once they go back to China. Because you have a miniprogram, you can see if your favorite painter in New York has painted anything new; you can buy it right there and have it sent back to China. That’s one of the biggest revolutions about miniprograms — that it enables you to sell to any Chinese person that has WeChat, which is basically everyone.” Now American technology is following China’s lead. The recently introduced WhatsApp Business, a platform for local businesses to provide information and communicate with their customers, bears striking similarities to miniprograms and has been gathering momentum in Mexico and India. Mark Zuckerberg’s public references earlier this year to “the digital equivalent of the living room” and “secure payments” echo much of what already exists on WeChat. Through Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, its marquee acquisitions, Facebook is the American tech company that comes closest to WeChat: It’s a messaging app, a social network and an e-commerce platform. Like WeChat, Facebook Pages and Instagram consolidate numerous businesses under one roof. You can imagine an Instagram where each account is a storefront, sort of like a miniprogram, where users might be able to make and show off their purchases without ever leaving the app. The gradual convergence toward the connected WeChat model speaks to a profound change in dynamic between Western and Chinese internet technologies. For decades, the online infrastructure — from design to programming languages to wireless protocols — came from the West. These sorts of innovations, often given away free or not immediately profitable, nevertheless bestow upon their makers a sort of soft power. They transcend cultural differences and help bridge them. For the first time, a Chinese concept is taking on that role. With WeChat miniprograms, we’re seeing a technology copied not to China, but from China. The ramifications of such a shift are subtle and pervasive, and many of them are most likely still to be realized. My conversation with Genaitay eventually turned to ByteDance, the creator of Jinri Toutiao and the short-form video platform TikTok , which has become the first Chinese-made product to cross over into Western internet consciousness. ByteDance is perhaps the hottest start-up in the world today, with a $78 billion valuation, and is increasing its efforts to move into productivity and search. It is a part of a younger generation of Chinese companies now reaching maturity, helmed by millennial founders and hungry for recognition in the outside world. It, too, is testing miniprograms. “If I was ByteDance — because they already have TikTok overseas, they can have an edge,” Genaitay said. “If they can successfully create a miniprogram ecosystem on Douyin” — the Chinese version of TikTok — “they could easily replicate it to TikTok.” They could, in other words, challenge WeChat by becoming a full-service app. Genaitay emphasized that, if you set aside its technology, ByteDance’s small-app efforts are still at an early stage, and it remains to be seen whether the company can open up what is currently a closed ecosystem accessible only to official brands. Indeed, miniprograms of the style we’ve come to expect on WeChat seem an odd fit with the world of TikTok, which is quirky and surreal rather than commercial. But if ByteDance can pull that off, it might be a revelation. Whatever it is that takes place when Chinese-style superapp-dom meets the American teenager, it sounds like the future of the internet.

Jamie Lauren Keiles,"Nick Walters listens to a bunch of different podcasts, but none speak to him the way “Failing Upwards” does. The weekly show, hosted by the men’s-wear enthusiasts and self-proclaimed “grown dirtbags” Lawrence Schlossman and James Harris, undertakes to navigate the “millennial male zeitgeist.” Mostly, they talk about clothes and New York. Walters, a 24-year-old commercial banker, lives in Cleveland. He first heard about the show from a friend and recognized himself not just in the hosts but also in its community of listeners — mainly guys on Instagram who share his perspective on fashion and life. “If I know that another guy listens to ‘Failing Upwards,’ we’re going to talk about it,” he says. “It’s kind of like a TV show, like if you’re into ‘Game of Thrones.’ ” Much like “Game of Thrones,” “Failing Upwards” claims its own extended universe. Fans are known to one another as the Fail Gang. They worship the same streetwear god (Jonah Hill) and a sartorial ritual known as “the fit check,” hypebeast-speak for “Who are you wearing?” Walters fantasizes about going on the show and already knows what he would wear: a pair of Yeezy Boost 700 Wave Runners, a John Elliott hoodie and Eric Emanuel basketball shorts. He likes these clothes, but just as important, he believes that this outfit would impress Schlossman and Harris. “I want to meet the hosts so bad,” he admits. “I want to be friends with them.” He plans on moving to New York someday, and he told me that if they cross paths, he believes that could happen. “We have enough similar interests and a similar sense of humor that, yeah, I think we would hit it off.” This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. All across the podcast realm, from the heights of self-help to the depths of true crime, imagined relationships are blossoming. Listeners may press play for the content, but many of them eventually come to nurture something like a one-way friendship with the hosts. This kind of daydreaming is an in-joke of the form, best articulated by a popular meme : On first glance, it appears to be a picture of a kid eating ice cream with his friends. Upon closer inspection, he’s actually alone; the three laughing women are models printed on a billboard advertising ice cream. The caption: “How it feels to listen to podcasts.” Among sociologists and armchair theorizers, this unique type of pining is known as a parasocial relationship — a term coined in 1956 to describe the connection between television viewers and a new class of entertainment personalities, including announcers, game-show hosts and anyone else who spoke in direct address to the camera. “The spectacular fact about such personae is that they can claim and achieve an intimacy with what are literally crowds of strangers,” the sociologists Richard Wohl and Donald Horton wrote in Psychiatry. “This intimacy, even if it is an imitation and a shadow of what is ordinarily meant by that word, is extremely influential with, and satisfying for, the great numbers who willingly receive it and share in it.” Parasocial relationships are, by definition, one-sided, but like normal friendships, they can deepen over time, enriched by the frequent and dependable appearance of the charming persona on the television set. Podcasts, with their own unique set of formal quirks, are perhaps even better poised to foment this kind of bond. An ideal complement to multitasking, the podcast is ingrained in daily household chores, the morning commute, the bedtime routine. A two-way conversation can be taxing. Podcasts allow us to get to know someone else without all the stress of making ourselves known. If listening demands anything at all, it’s only a bit of imagination. As hosts chatter on, we might picture their faces, their posture, their clothes, the empty cans of seltzer on the table, perhaps even their off-air lives beyond the show. “The host is this disembodied voice that is pervading your intimate spaces, so there’s kind of that room for imaginative bonding between the listener,” says Gina Delvac, producer of the friendship podcast “Call Your Girlfriend,” hosted by Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow. “You have to remember that there’s no fourth wall. When you’re talking to someone, you’re whispering in their ear. You’re in the shower with them. You’re on their commute to work.” Over hours of listening, the asymmetry increases. Hosts begin to feel like dear friends, while listeners remain eternal strangers. For the hosts themselves, and other figures who exist within the extended universe of a show, the lopsidedness can feel awkward or uncanny. When Delvac — a silent but known character in the “Call Your Girlfriend” universe — meets fans on the street, she’s often consumed by a feeling of amnesia. “They’re like: ‘Oh, my God. We know each other. We know each other so well!’ And I’m like, ‘Did we go to school together?’ Was she, like, my sister’s friend? ‘How do I know you?’ I’m, like, racking my brain,” she explains. “It can seriously feel sometimes, from the producer or podcaster end, like having a brain injury or some weird sci-fi disease.” This sense of connection to a distant stranger begins, unsurprisingly, with religion. Fanaticus , the Latin origin of “fan,” was used to describe female temple attendants driven into frenzy by devotion to the gods. This type of chaotic piousness, as a secular behavior, might be traced to the mid-1800s, a time when mass culture was on the rise. In a recent New Yorker article, “Superfans: A Love Story,” the writer Michael Schulman finds early examples in the concert-hall frenzy known as Lisztomania and the protests in England that followed the fictional death of Sherlock Holmes. The shortened word “fan” first appeared around 1900 in reference to the enthusiastic crowds at baseball games. Throughout the 20th century, the term would grow in scope to include worshipers of any entertainment figure — from matinee idols to Elvis to the Beatles. At that point, such devotion was a personal affliction, enjoyed alone in an adolescent daydream. Though fans might write letters, attend concerts or join clubs, the ability to band together as a group was still somewhat limited by the bounds of time and space. Perhaps nowhere on the internet can you find a larger and more vociferous collection of fans than Reddit, where topic-based forums — subreddits — dedicated to everything from K-pop to the Marvel Cinematic Universe to “BoJack Horseman” attract passionate users trading news, memes and wild fan theories. Sometimes Reddit’s online fandoms surge into the real world in surprising ways — making careers, rescuing canceled shows and changing fictional story arcs in real time. When an A.M.A. Spawned a Mini-Series During a 2013 Reddit A.M.A. (Ask Me Anything), the actor Benedict Cumberbatch said the literary character he most wanted to portray was Patrick Melrose. Cumberbatch went on to star in “Patrick Melrose,” Showtime’s 2018 mini-series adaptation of Edward St. Aubyn’s novels, after the show’s creators saw his response and got in touch. Number of comments on Benedict Cumberbatch’s A.M.A.: 13,700 How Emilia Clarke Was Thanked After the (much-maligned) “Game of Thrones” series finale, fans on the subreddit r/freefolk banded together to express their gratitude to the actress Emilia Clarke for portraying Daenerys Targaryen by raising nearly $150,000 for her charity, SameYou. Number of times Clarke says “thank you” in her Instagram video response: 11 When a Subreddit Saved ‘The Expanse’ When Syfy canceled “The Expanse” after three seasons in May 2018, fans on the subreddit r/theexpanse mobilized to save it — even hiring a plane to tow a #SaveTheExpanse banner above Amazon Studios headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif. The fourth season debuts on Dec. 13, and Amazon has renewed the show for a fifth season. Increase in comments on r/theexpanse on May 10, 2018, the day the show was canceled: 491 percent How a ‘Westworld’ Plot Was Twisted In 2017, the creators of HBO’s “Westworld” decided to change a plot twist in the second season’s third episode after Reddit fans correctly predicted it. r/westworld subscribers: 672,000 How McDonald’s Got Sauced In October 2017, McDonald’s offered a “one-time-only, limited-edition” run of Szechuan sauce, a discontinued condiment featured as a plot point in the popular cartoon “Rick and Morty,” after a Redditor created a petition to bring back the sauce. Increase in posts and comments on r/rickandmorty in the two days around the Szechuan debut: 323.9 percent Our modern sense of “fandom” — not just 50 million Elvis fans, but a community of 50 million Elvis fans — most likely began with the Star Trek conventions of the 1970s, which helped create a new infrastructure for fan engagement. These early gatherings of a few thousand people in a rented hotel ballroom would eventually give rise to phenomena like ComicCon, enormous gatherings that have reconceived fans not just as passive viewers but as active, and highly integral, participants. They are no longer merely worshipers of a top-down product but creators and stewards of a shared, bottom-up identity. Today’s fandom is more like a stateless nation, formed around a shared viewing heritage but perpetuated through the imaginations and interrelations of those who enjoy and defend it. When their common cause comes under threat — through chart competition, cancellation or critique — fans can organize to increase streams, denigrate critics and rally executives to right perceived wrongs. Often they even resort to using the tools of politics while seeking redress. After this year’s disappointing “Game of Thrones” finale, more than 1.7 million fans signed a Change.org petition to remake Season 8 with “competent writers.” (So far, no change has been made.) In an age defined by political dysfunction, the appeal of any sort of democratically secured victory — however small, however pathetic — isn’t hard to understand. Now that the fandom template has been cemented, it has begun to attach to more obscure or arcane media enterprises: indie-pop artists like Charli XCX, faceless meme makers and even podcasts. The profit model of the podcast world is arranged, perhaps serendipitously, to capitalize on this type of fan relationship. Justin Lapidus, vice president of growth marketing and digital products for the direct-to-consumer linen brand Brooklinen, says podcast listeners are a perfect match for the company’s core demographic: 18-to-54-year-olds with “higher household incomes.” When he looks for shows to advertise on, he tends to make “efficient” plays for smaller, but more committed, audiences. “It doesn’t really matter what genre their podcast is in,” he says. “Whatever they buy, their listeners will buy, for the most part.” Beyond advertising, podcasts that achieve solvency tend to do so through a stitched-together network of social-media hustles, the sum of which serves to cultivate and monetize an audience’s sense of connection. Though large podcasts often enjoy financial support from traditional media companies and emergent podcast networks, many small and midsize shows — arguably those most indicative of the form — have come to rely on Patreon, a membership platform that invites fans to become financial supporters of creative projects in exchange for a tiered benefits package of the creator’s invention. At the lowest membership tiers, usually $1 to $5 per month, podcast supporters receive benefits like bonus episodes or access to V.I.P. chat rooms. As the tiers increase in price, the rewards grow more substantial, often involving direct engagement with the hosts or entry into the universe of the show itself. Through these high-tier benefits, the parasocial bond can take on a degree of two-sidedness, absorbing qualities of conventional friendship, but only in a partial, commoditized way. For $51 per month, the hosts of “Dumb People Town,” a comic “celebration of dumb people doing dumb things,” will visit your social-media profile, then film themselves reacting to your life in the same way they break down stories on the show. For $100 per month, the host of “McMansion Hell” will make fun of “a building of your choice”; the hosts of “Mueller, She Wrote” will invite you on the podcast to “share your fantasy indictment league picks.” According to Wyatt Jenkins, senior vice president for product at Patreon, podcasts are the second-largest category on the site, and the fastest-growing. In the past three years, the number of Patreon pages for podcasts has quadrupled, while revenue intake in the category has increased eightfold. “Roughly 40 percent of our members — this is a guess — are probably doing it altruistically,” he says. “As a vertical, podcasting communities retain memberships very, very well. A lot higher than some other verticals. They release regular weekly content, and they create this incredibly strong bond.” [Read about paying for a “luxury internet.”] Because both Patreon pages and ads depend on a sense of personal connection, podcast hosts benefit further when an audience corrals itself into something like a community. This most often occurs in Facebook groups, Discord servers or subreddits — online forums that transform isolated passive listeners into active participants. Some podcast tribes even claim their own names: There are the naddpoles ( “Naddpod” ) and the MBMBAMbinos ( “My Brother, My Brother and Me” ). There’s the Scoop Troop ( “Hollywood Handbook” ), the Wholigans ( “Who? Weekly” ) and Baby Nation ( “The Baby-sitters Club Club” ). Fans of “Pod Save America” can be recognized by their T-shirts, which proudly proclaim “Friend of the Pod.” When these online communities are especially successful, they tend to spin off into subsidiary forums. The wildly popular true-crime podcast “My Favorite Murder” supports a vast constellation of unofficial Facebook groups, many only tenuously connected to the subject of the show. Listeners, who self-describe as Murderinos, can now join “My Favorite Curls” (for murder fans with curly hair), “My Favorite Murder Disnerderinos” (for fans who love murder and Disney), “My Favorite Skin Condition” (for Murderinos with eczema and psoriasis) and “My Favorite Free Emotional Labor” (for calling out and educating problematic Murderinos). In one metagroup, called “My Favorite Thunderdome,” members can tag Murderinos from other subgroups and sub-subgroups for the sole purpose of arguing. This group puts out a regular roundup, “The Weekly Thunder,” which summarizes drama from elsewhere in the “My Favorite Murder” Facebook universe. Once you’re this many layers deep, the podcast itself becomes something of an afterthought — just one moving part in the more complex Murderino ecosystem. “Some of them are people who are, like, too into murder,” says Sophia Carter-Kahn, a frequent lurker in the group who listens to the show only occasionally. “I’ve seen people who are like, ‘I bought this tooth online that’s from this, like, murder victim.’ ” At the furthest end of this fandom paradigm, the community itself is large enough to begin to overtake the very podcast it came from. The subreddit forum for the left-wing comedy podcast “Chapo Trap House” is, at least in name, a forum for discussing the weekly show. In practice, it serves as an erratic clearinghouse for whatever content its fans feel moved to post: socialist memes, cringe-worthy right-wing tweets and, very often, objections to the show itself. Even among fans, such critiques are numerous, prone to rebuking the show’s overwhelming whiteness, its inconsistently calibrated irony and its outsize reputation on the left. (The show takes in about $142,000 per month on Patreon.) Critiques of the show itself are so frequent that they’ve now become a kind of meme on the subreddit. In one semi-sarcastic post calling for a “Chapo General Strike,” fans joked that they would cancel their subscriptions unless the show met certain demands: a single nonwhite guest, equity for the producer Chris Wade, the host Felix Biederman’s naming four women he likes who aren’t in his immediate family. Among the more serious, and more ubiquitous, demands was a call for the show to cancel, denounce or otherwise divorce itself from the host Amber A’Lee Frost, who regularly transgresses the discursive norms of the online left. (Frost most recently drew flak for giving a flippant interview to the British website Spiked, which ran under the headline “Meet the Anti-Woke Left.”) Frost, for her part, has called the show’s subreddit an “incubator of smug, joyless, antisocial sanctimony,” which raises the question: What, exactly, are its members really fans of? If a podcast is not its particular content, and the certain set of people who choose to make that content, then what exactly is a podcast at all? A few years ago you might have said podcasting was just radio for the internet. Today, the audio is almost beside the point. Today’s podcast hosts are not just on-air personae, but community managers, designers of incentives, spokespeople for subscription toothbrushes and business-to-business software. The worth of a podcast is no longer just its content, but rather the sum of the relations it produces — fan to host, fan to fan, fake friends eating ice cream on billboards together.

George Gene Gustines,"This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series , which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve. Comic books have been around since the 1930s , each story taking shape as it moves from its writer to its artist s (usually a penciler and an inker) and then to its letterer and colorist. Today, that team effort, which also includes an editor reviewing the work and mindful of deadlines, remains largely the same. But while the way writers and editors work is relatively unchanged, computers and technology have broadened the options for illustrators — some of whom have traded pencils and inks for styluses — and revolutionized the roles of letterers and colorists, in speed, output and artistry. This technological evolution did not go exactly as some had imagined it might. “I recall in the late ’80s, we were all so sure that every discipline of comics creation would switch over to being done with the aid of the personal computer,” said Mark Chiarello , a veteran of the comic book industry. “Well, 30 years later, people pencil and ink comics in relatively the same way that they have since the art form began,” he said. “But the job of colorist and letterer has changed and been completely taken over by the computer.” Mr. Chiarello began as an assistant to an editor at Marvel Comics , worked as a colorist at Dark Horse Comics and later was the art director at DC Comics , where he worked for 26 years until this January. He is now a freelance artist and has witnessed many attempts to shift toward digitally produced comics. When Shatter Special No. 1 , published by First Comics , was released in 1985 , its cover proclaimed it “the first computerized comic!” The entire issue — except for the coloring — was done on a Macintosh. The interior art had rigid word balloons and recalled the early days of video games, with pixelated, somewhat clunky images. But it was innovative and a best seller . In 1990, DC Comics published Batman: Digital Justice, which was produced on a newer Macintosh, this one with 3-D renderings and color. Still, digital comics took years to blossom. “It took a few years of stumbling around in the digital darkness and trying to invent custom-designed software before all comics companies embraced the creative software to end all softwares: Photoshop ,” Mr. Chiarello said. Today, we get lush images like those by Yanick Paquette , who has drawn many covers and comics for DC, including “ Wonder Woman: Earth One ,” a modern retelling of the Amazon’s origin, written by Grant Morrison . Mr. Paquette’s first published work was “Harem Nights,” a hand-drawn erotic story published by Fantagraphics Books in 1994 , and his first foray into digital was a 2000 cover for “Batman Inc.” Mr. Paquette said it was not an easy transition . “Working in Photoshop, I couldn’t do a circle,” he recalled. (They looked like eggs.) He found his footing using a Cintiq , a tablet that allows the user to draw directly on the screen, which has increased in size and resolution. “I don’t buy erasers anymore. I don’t buy inks. But every time there is a new Cintiq, I kind of indulge,” he said. In Mr. Paquette’s view, readers are wary of digital art; their minds may look for tricks or shortcuts. “When something is too perfect, too crisp, you lose the human sensibility,” he said. To draw an army of Stormtroopers, he could draw one and digitally create a battalion, but he does not. “If I spend all my time drawing all the Stormtroopers, they are humanized and your relationship to the art is different.” The relationship between a penciler (who lays out the page and draws the initial images) and an inker (who gives proper weight to each line) has also changed. It “used to be a good inker was the best way to elevate a penciler’s work. Nowadays it’s a good colorist,” said Karl Kesel , an inker whose work was first published in 1984 . “Technology has reversed the order of artistic importance in comics from penciler-inker-colorist to penciler-colorist-inker. As an inker, I hate to say that,” he said. “But it’s true.” Mr. Kesel inks on paper, but he believes the biggest digital innovation is the computer’s undo function : “Don’t like that line? Click. Gone.” Technology has certainly affected the role of the letterer, who adds the word balloons, editorial captions and sound effects to the page. “We get paid less but we can do more, thanks to Mr. Computer,” said Chris Eliopoulos , a letterer and cartoonist. Mr. Eliopoulos got his start in the industry in 1989 as an intern in Marvel’s production department. The head letterer, Ken Lopez , taught him the craft, which Mr. Eliopoulos described as analog lettering . Later, he would show Mr. Lopez how to use a computer to letter. Mr. Eliopoulos does not see the process as very different. “I still letter by hand. I just use a different tool ,” he said. But whereas the old days of lettering had many accouterments — the art boards, adhesive tape to steady them, T-squares, lettering guides and pens — a computer now serves as nearly a one-stop shop. “ The two disciplines, coloring and lettering gravitated to two different programs,” he said. “Colorists flew to Photoshop and letterers to Adobe Illustrator.” At his peak, Mr. Eliopoulos was hand-lettering 30 comics, each averaging 22 pages, per month. But working digitally is faster and more lucrative, he said. A penciler could make $100 per page, but typically finish only one per day. A letterer could earn less per page, but produce several and make more than an artist. For the popular “I Am …” series of graphic novel biographies of historical figures, which he illustrates and which are written by Brad Meltzer , and for his own projects, like a forthcoming children’s book, “ The Yawns Are Coming, ” Mr. Eliopoulos uses a hybrid of freehand digital lettering, eschewing his library of fonts. “It takes more time, but I think anyone you talk to will say, if we could, we’d stick to hand lettering because it’s organic and it’s art.” The artistry of coloring has improved by leaps and bounds. The variations of reproducible colors increased and — whether on paper or viewed digitally — the result was richer. When Alex Sinclair began coloring in the early 1990s, the process was a true labor of love that required acetates, Dr. Ph. Martin dyes , color charts and codes for available hues written on guides for others to implement. Mr. Sinclair got his break through a talent search announced in “WildC.A.T.s,” an independent comic book series drawn by Jim Lee , one of the giants of the industry even then. Mr. Lee, who is now the co-publisher and chief creative officer of DC Comics , was eager to push toward digital coloring and Mr. Sinclair had to get up to speed. He was familiar with Illustrator , but using its tools to try to mimic those of Photoshop was difficult. “It was like coloring with the opposite hand,” Mr. Sinclair said. He read a “Photoshop Wow” book to teach himself the program one chapter at a time. Tablets were the next revolution for colorists. “Once the tablets came out, it felt more like painting,” he said. The Photoshop brush tools had also become more sophisticated. In 2003, when Mr. Sinclair worked on “Batman: Hush,” he digitally colored the main characters and painted the watercolor backgrounds by hand . The inspiration was Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” in 2002, which was hand-drawn, not computer animated. All the backgrounds were hand painted and it was gorgeous,” he recalled. “You could totally tell it was organic .” For Hush, the watercolors gave Gotham City its own distinct look. Analog or digital makes no difference to Maggie Thompson , a former senior editor of the “Comic Buyer’s Guide,” which covered the industry from 1971 to 2013 . “I’m there for the story,” she said.  One’s views on the production changes are subjective, she said. “Comics went from flat color to toned color. There’s a nostalgic quality to flat color, but I bet colorists don’t like it,” she said. And while digital art is pristine, traditional art could be rife with blue-line marks, smudges and erasures. But those imperfections show the human effort of the work and are catnip to original art collectors. Ms. Thompson owns an unpublished comic book cover from 1972 by John Severin . It depicts Captain America and the Howling Commandos, an elite group of soldiers in the Marvel universe , and required some paste-up corrections, which are now slipping off. “ I wouldn’t have that problem with digital art,” she lamented. “But I also wouldn’t have the original art.”","Nov. 13, 2019",New York Times,NA,Superhero or Supervillain?

Brian X. Chen,"You’re walking around and a thought occurs: “I should check my phone.” The phone comes out of your pocket. You type a message. Then your eyes remain glued to the screen, even when you walk across the street. We all do this kind of distracted walking, or “ twalking .” (Yes, this term is really a thing.) The behavior has spawned debates among lawmakers about whether walking and texting should be illegal . Some cities, such as Honolulu and Rexburg, Idaho, have gone beyond talk and banned distracted walking altogether. But we shouldn’t let that reassure us. Last year, pedestrian deaths in the United States were at their highest point since 1990 , with distracted drivers and bigger vehicles the chief culprits. So being fixated on a screen while walking can’t be safe. “We know research-wise it’s not a good idea, and common-sense-wise it can’t be a good idea,” said Ken Kolosh, a manager of statistics at the National Safety Council, a nonprofit that focuses on eliminating preventable deaths. “We don’t ever want to blame the victim, but there’s personal responsibility all of us have.” So why do we do it? I talked to neuroscientists and psychologists about our conduct. All agreed that texting while walking might be a form of addictive behavior. But this column isn’t about pointing fingers. Rather, now is a good time to reflect on why we are so glued to our phones, what we know about the risks and how we can take control of our personal technology rather than let it control us. People are, by nature, information-seeking creatures. When we regularly check our phones, we are snacking on information from devices that offer an all-you-can-eat buffet of information. Our information-foraging tendencies evolved from the behavior of animals foraging for food for survival, said Dr. Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist and co-author of the book “ The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World .” Studies have shown that our brains feel rewarded when we receive information, which drives us to seek more. That’s similar to how our appetites feel sated after we eat. In some ways, smartphones were designed to be irresistible to information-seeking creatures. Dr. Gazzaley drew this analogy: An animal will probably stay in a tree to gather all of its nuts before moving on to the next one. That’s because the animal is weighing the cost of getting to the next tree against the diminishing benefit of staying. With humans and smartphones, there is no cost to switching between email, text messages and apps like Facebook. “The next tree is right there: It’s a link to the next webpage, a shift to the next tab,” he said. “We transfer so easily that we don’t have to use up the nuts to move on to the next one.” So we get stuck in cycles. At what point is this considered addiction? Not all constant phone use was considered addictive, said Steven Sussman, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California. External pressures, like a demanding job, could force people to frequently check their phones. But when people check their devices just to enhance their mood, this could be a sign of a developing problem. Another signal of addictive behavior is becoming preoccupied with smartphone use when you should be doing something else. An even clearer indicator is what happens when the phone is taken away. “Let’s say you go out to the mountains and you don’t get reception, so you can’t use a smartphone,” Dr. Sussman said. “Do you feel a sense of relief? Or do you feel, wow, I want to get out of these mountains — I want to use the smartphone. If you feel the latter, that’s toward the addictive direction.” Jim Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that evaluates tech products and media for families, said there needed to be a broad public awareness campaign over the dangers of walking and texting in parallel with distracted driving. “You have distracted pedestrians and distracted drivers, so it’s the double whammy,” he said. “Tech addiction hits in both ways.” Just how dangerous is distracted walking? The answer is: It’s still unclear. Distracted walking is a relatively new area of research. There have been few studies to show the consequences of what the behavior can lead to. And some of the studies conflict with one another. This year, New York City’s Transportation Department published one study , including data collected about pedestrian-related incidents in New York and nationwide, which found little concrete evidence to link distracted walking with pedestrian fatalities or injuries. Yet the National Safety Council said the national data cited in the New York study did not include information on whether pedestrians were engaged in other tasks at the time of the incidents. The council instead published a study conducted by the University of Maryland in 2013. It found that between 2000 and 2011, there were hundreds of emergency room visits related to phone use while walking, and the primary cause of injury was a fall. While more research needs to be done on distracted walking, it’s indisputable that walking while texting is less safe than paying attention to your surroundings. “When you’re busy doing secondary tasks like texting, you don’t judge gap distances in traffic as well, you walk slower, you make poor decisions, and you’re not aware of your surroundings,” said Mr. Kolosh of the National Safety Council. Obviously, the answer to not getting into dangerous situations by walking and texting is not to walk and text at the same time. But that’s easier said than done, since people have trouble reining in their tech use. So several experts recommended exercises in self-control. Melanie Greenberg, a clinical psychologist and the author of “ The Stress-Proof Brain ,” said people could practice being more mindful by asking themselves any of these questions: Is this the most important thing for me to be doing right now? Am I controlling my destiny, or am I letting tech control it? How is my posture? Am I stressing my body out? Am I going to cause myself harm? Reducing access to the device can also be helpful, Dr. Gazzaley said. You could carry your phone in your bag instead of your pocket, making it more troublesome to pull out, for example. The National Safety Council said that when pedestrians have to check their phones, they should stop walking and stand in a safe place. It also advised people wearing earphones to listen at a low volume. Chris Marcellino, a former Apple engineer who led the development of the original iPhone’s notifications, recommended going into the phone’s settings and switching off notifications for all apps except those that are most important to you, like work-related apps. “These are things that aren’t pertinent to your life that are bombarding you all the time,” he said. Other tools, like the “do not disturb” function on both iPhones and Android phones , can be set to shush notifications temporarily. Even knowing all of this, I caught myself the other day checking Twitter while crossing a parking lot. I reflected on this and realized Twitter was a waste of time. So I deleted the app. Then I installed another one to block the Twitter website from my phone — just for good measure.","Nov. 13, 2019",New York Times,NA,Texting While Walking Is Dangerous.

Ben Casselman,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ben Casselman, an economics and business reporter, discussed the tech he’s using. You compile complicated data sets and distill them into stories for our readers. What are the tech tools and methods behind this madness? “Madness” is tough but fair. If you walk by my desk on any given day you’ll find my computer monitor littered with charts, spreadsheets and way more Chrome tabs than any sane person would consider reasonable. And my physical desktop is just as cluttered with half-used notebooks, printed-out economics papers and my trusty TI-86 calculator (a holdover from college calculus that I still find inexplicably useful — apparently a theme among economics reporters at The Times). Really, though, the most important piece of technology on my desk is my landline telephone. I think some people have the idea that “data journalism” means staring at spreadsheets until a story magically appears, but in the real world that almost never happens. The best stories almost always emerge from talking to people, whether they are experts or just ordinary people affected by the issues we write about. They’re the ones who pose the questions that data can help answer, or who help explain the trends that the data reveals, or who can provide the wrinkles and nuances that the data glosses over. For example, one of my favorite stories from the past year is one that I wrote with my colleague Conor Dougherty about investors buying up single-family homes . We had access to a huge data set — millions and millions of real estate transactions — that showed how investors had come to dominate the market for starter homes in many cities. But what really made the story come to life was when we zoomed in on one house that had changed hands several times and got to talk to all the people who had touched it — the investor who flipped it, the family that bought it, the would-be buyer who kept losing out to investors. At the end of the day, data isn’t the story; people are the story. Fair enough. But I assume you aren’t doing all that data analysis on your phone. Or on your TI calculator, for that matter. Yes, that’s true. I do most of my data analysis in a statistical programming language called R. It lets me work with data sets that have hundreds of thousands or even millions of rows, much too large for a spreadsheet program like Excel. It also makes it easy to automate tasks that I perform regularly — so when the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report comes out, for example, I can download the new data and update my analysis with just a few keystrokes. R also has a great suite of tools for making charts, which is a critical part of my work. The Times has the best graphics team in the business, and I can’t come close to doing what it does in terms of making beautiful, readable charts and interactive graphics. But I’m not trying to make charts like that. I just need something that lets me spot a trend or relationship, or that helps identify examples that are worth exploring further. For that, quick-and-dirty is just fine. In terms of hardware, I wish I could tell you I was running some hotshot rig with multicore processors and a boatload of RAM. But these days I do pretty much all my work on a standard-issue laptop. I store some data in the cloud, but that’s mostly because I don’t want to lose it all if my computer melts down. That’s mostly a reflection of how quickly technology has improved. A few years back, when I was at The Wall Street Journal, I had to go begging for extra processing power, and even then my co-workers used to complain that my computer sounded like a jet airplane struggling to gain altitude. These days, my computer can manage much larger data sets without breaking a sweat. There has been a running debate in journalism circles about whether reporters should learn to code. I take it you’re firmly in the “yes” camp? Not at all! Coding has been a valuable tool for me, and I’m glad that more journalists are learning to code (and that more coders are getting interested in journalism). But I was a reporter long before I learned how to code, and most of the reporters I admire most have never written a line of code in their life. I do think that pretty much all reporters need to have a basic comfort with numbers and statistics. Not that everyone needs to be able to run regressions or calculate p-values, or even define what a p-value is (which isn’t easy , by the way). But they should be fluent enough in the language of statistics to understand when an argument makes sense, and when it’s suspect enough that they should start probing more deeply. And, yes, I think you should be able to do a percent change calculation without turning to Google for help. In the last couple of years, The Times has developed a course to teach basic data skills to reporters and editors — things like how to vet data to make sure it’s legitimate, how to evaluate statistical claims and how to use a spreadsheet program to explore a data set. One of the core messages is that you can do a lot of this stuff without learning to code. I do a session where I walk through how to replicate a story of mine using nothing but Google Sheets and a few basic functions. Outside of work, what tech product are you personally obsessed with? What do you do with it? Despite my love of data, I’m not much of a techie in my nonwork life. I don’t have a smart watch or a smart thermostat or anything like that, and I still had an old cathode-ray TV until my in-laws finally broke down and sent us a flat screen. (I did give my wife a HomePod, Apple’s smart speaker, for her birthday a couple of years ago, but it mostly just terrifies me by having Siri pipe up seemingly at random.) Probably my most prized digital possession is my kitchen scale. I’ve gotten really into baking sourdough bread, without any commercial yeast, which means it’s about the lowest-tech form of baking imaginable.","Nov. 13, 2019",New York Times,NA,"In Data Journalism, Tech Matters Less Than the People",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/technology/personaltech/data-journalism-economics.html
Brooks Barnes,"LOS ANGELES — Nickelodeon will make a “SpongeBob SquarePants” spinoff for Netflix as part of a multiyear content-production deal that reflects the pressure on Netflix to fortify itself against new streaming competition, notably Disney Plus. Netflix and Nickelodeon announced a deal on Wednesday for Nickelodeon to create and produce original animated feature films and television series based on Nickelodeon’s library of characters. Shows based on completely new characters are also part of the agreement. The companies gave no specifics on characters, the number of shows or how many years. But the partnership involves a music-based project centered on Squidward , the malcontent anthropomorphic octopus on “SpongeBob SquarePants,” according to two people briefed on the matter , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss still private details. The people said the overall deal was worth more than $200 million to Nickelodeon. Disney Plus, Disney’s streaming service, became available on Tuesday. In a statement on Wednesday, Disney said 10 million people had signed up for the service, surpassing analyst expectations. As the so-called streaming wars heat up, children’s programming has become one of the most competitive fronts. Netflix has ramped up production of cartoons, children’s sitcoms and animated movies, in part to compensate for Disney content that is leaving the service. Disney Plus will be the streaming home for everything Disney, Pixar, Marvel, “Star Wars” and National Geographic. HBO Max, the coming app from WarnerMedia, announced a deal with “Sesame Street” last month that will bring, for the first time, most of the show’s five-decade library to streaming: more than 4,500 episodes. The deal announced on Wednesday reflects a strategic shift at Nickelodeon and its owner, Viacom, in general. Rather than build a streaming service of its own — and with its cable networks in decline because of cord cutting — Viacom has decided to become a kind of Hollywood arms dealer, producing content for whatever streaming service can pay the most. MTV, also owned by Viacom, has been making shows for online buyers, including a reboot of “The Real World” for Facebook . “Nickelodeon’s next step forward is to keep expanding beyond linear platforms, and our broader content partnership with Netflix is a key path toward that goal,” Brian Robbins, Nickelodeon’s president, said in the news release. The two companies have a long history. Nickelodeon licensed hits like “SpongeBob” and “Dora the Explorer” to Netflix starting in 2009, when streaming was in its infancy. Viacom walked away in 2013 — ratings for “SpongeBob” on Nickelodeon had plunged — but made a new deal with Netflix a couple of years ago to supply the service with original content based on Nickelodeon’s “Loud House” and “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” properties, among others. “Nickelodeon has generated scores of characters that kids love, and we look forward to telling wholly original stories that reimagine and expand on the worlds they inhabit,” Melissa Cobb, Netflix’s vice president of original animation, said in the news release.","Nov. 13, 2019",New York Times,NA,‘SpongeBob’ Spinoff Highlights Netflix-Nickelodeon Deal,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/business/media/netflix-nickelodeon-spongebob-squarepants.html
Peter Eavis,"The rapid expansion of WeWork’s office-space empire caused the company’s losses to more than double in the third quarter, according to a company presentation. WeWork lost $1.25 billion in the three months that ended in September, up from $497 million in the same period a year earlier, according to the document, obtained on Wednesday by The New York Times. Revenue increased about 94 percent, to $934 million. The numbers show why WeWork’s planned initial public offering flamed out so spectacularly. The company was forced to withdraw the offering at the end of September after investors grew nervous about the company’s finances and its unusual corporate governance. Adam Neumann , its co-founder, stepped down as chief executive under pressure. Vicki Bryan , chief executive of Bond Angle, a research firm, said WeWork should have told investors during the I.P.O. process that losses were escalating in the third quarter. “They knew the bulk of this and kept the public in the dark,” she said. WeWork leases office space, refurbishes it and then rents it out to its customers. In the belief that there is a growing appetite for such space, it has added hundreds of new locations around the world. But doing so has cost hundreds of millions of dollars. At the end of September, WeWork’s presentation said, the company had $2 billion in cash, a number that included $692 million of restricted cash. That sum compares with slightly over $3 billion in total cash at the end of June, implying the company used $1 billion of cash in three months. The document did not, however, provide a cash-flow statement that would show exactly how much cash the company spent in the quarter. SoftBank, WeWork’s largest outside shareholder , moved last month to rescue the company . It accelerated an equity investment and announced plans for WeWork to sell bonds to investors. SoftBank’s overhaul of WeWork involves getting out of noncore businesses and focusing on profitable markets. The company is also expected to lay off thousands of employees in the coming weeks. WeWork disclosed its financial performance through the end of June in documents it filed for the I.P.O. Because it scrapped the offering and remains a private company, WeWork is not required to publicly release financial statements. The latest numbers come from a presentation of selected financial data that is provided to investors who own WeWork bonds. Occupancy at WeWork’s locations is declining, according to the presentation. In the third quarter, WeWork had enough members to fill the equivalent of 79 percent of available desks at the company’s locations, down from 84 percent a year earlier. Such a dip might be expected because WeWork was opening locations at a fast clip . But occupancy dropped even at locations open more than two years, to 87 percent in the third quarter from 90 percent a year earlier. Older locations are generally more profitable than new ones, in part because they have had time to fill up. The presentation reveals the eye-popping rate at which WeWork has been adding space. At the end of September, WeWork had 625 locations, an 87 percent increase from a year earlier. It is now in 127 cities, up from 83. WeWork is not out of trouble until SoftBank’s rescue plan is in place. As part of the bailout, SoftBank, led by the investor Masayoshi Son, made a $1.5 billion investment in WeWork equity last month. Under the plan, WeWork would also sell over $2 billion of bonds to raise new money, though it is not clear how much appetite exists for the company’s debt. Its existing bonds have plunged in price. SoftBank’s plan also involves buying WeWork stock from existing shareholders, including Mr. Neumann. But while its purchases would give it nearly 80 percent of WeWork’s stock, SoftBank would end up with just under half of WeWork’s voting power. It is not clear how SoftBank intends to exert control without a majority of the votes. A financial metric that the company likes to emphasize in its communications with investors also weakened in the third quarter. That metric, which the company calls its “location contribution margin” and does not include significant costs, fell to 9 percent in the quarter, down from 12 percent a year earlier.","Nov. 13, 2019",New York Times,NA,WeWork Lost $1.25 Billion in Third Quarter,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/business/dealbook/wework-third-quarter-earnings.html
Bill Wasik,"“Hey, everyone!” the world’s eighth-richest man said, with a bit too much brio, as he waved to the crowd at Gaston Hall in Washington. “It’s really great to be at Georgetown with all of you today.” But then the smile fell away from Mark Zuckerberg’s face, and there was an awkward pause as he licked his lips and looked at the crowd. With his next lines — an acknowledgment of the death, earlier that day, of the longtime House of Representatives member Elijah Cummings — he settled into a more sober mood, which he sustained for the remainder of his speech. It was clear that Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, knew the message he had come to deliver, bearing the awkward title “Standing for Voice and Free Expression,” would not be an especially popular one on a college campus in deep-blue Washington, and that indeed he himself might not be an especially popular man. Over the course of just five or so years, and accelerating significantly in November 2016 with the election of Donald Trump, there had been a sea change in how Americans, especially liberal Americans, regarded Facebook. If, during the Obama era, there was a nagging suspicion among critics of Silicon Valley that Zuckerberg’s company and its fellow internet giants had become too large — their market power too great, their sway over the political and cultural discourse too absolute — the election left millions of people convinced that those suspicions were absolutely correct. Now there were calls among prominent Democratic politicians for tough regulation, even for “breaking up” the company. One of the most vocal among them, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, had recently surged to a near-lead in the presidential primary race; in leaked audio from a Facebook town hall, Zuckerberg lamented her ascent and vowed, in the event she were elected president, to “go to the mat” and fight. This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. All of it — the fierce criticism in the media, the political maneuvering among Democrats, the leak from his own staff — had fostered a sense of a company under siege, and it was easy to hear this Georgetown speech in October as a simple and defiant response, a middle finger raised to the haters. To those eager to regulate speech on his platform or hold Facebook legally accountable for misinformation, Zuckerberg offered reminders of the First Amendment and the American tradition of free expression more broadly. He pointed out how that tradition benefited movements the audience seemed likely to support (#BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo) and contrasted Facebook’s approach with that of Chinese-owned services like TikTok, the new sensation among teenagers in the United States and elsewhere, which has been accused of censoring mentions of anti-China protests in Hong Kong. Afterward, observers analyzing the speech were unimpressed, seeing it as at best a reiteration of Facebook’s perennial self-serving arguments and at worst a vacuous word salad. (Zuckerberg “doubles down on free speech,” as Wired put it, while Recode sniffed that he offered “a lot of nothing.”) By the following week, the appearance at Gaston Hall had been filed away as just one more maneuver in Zuckerberg’s continuing charm offensive toward the political class, his sole goal being to maintain the status quo. But whether Zuckerberg intended it or not, his speech showed glimmers of something else. There were hints of a more profound sense of threat and dislocation — perhaps, even, a signal of Zuckerberg’s understanding, conscious or not, that the status quo might no longer be sustainable. Despite all his efforts at optimism, Zuckerberg acknowledged some basic problems with Facebook that had become impossible to ignore. Having built a machine to connect the world and let everyone have a say — thereby giving rise to a new social reality in which, as he put it at Georgetown, “people no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers in politics or media to make their voices heard” — Facebook now had to concede that there was no foolproof way to stop those voices from saying things that were unfactual or malevolent, or to stop their friends and followers from believing them. In part, this was because of a genuine Catch-22 involving scale: Phenomenal size had allowed Facebook and its fellow American tech giants to become the center of online life, but now they could not correct the most toxic problems of online spaces without wielding even more unsettling levels of power. “While I certainly worry about an erosion of truth,” Zuckerberg said, “I don’t think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true.” Also revealing was his take on his Chinese competitors, which went well beyond just criticizing them on free-expression grounds. “China is building its own internet focused on very different values, and it’s now exporting their vision of the internet to other countries,” he said, informing his American audience that its sense of an internet dominated utterly by Facebook was by now a parochial notion. “A decade ago, almost all of the major internet platforms were American,” he said. “Today, six of the top 10 are Chinese.” This remark was directed at his antitrust-minded critics, but it was also a reminder that however bad Facebook might be for democracy, the alternatives might be worse. For a decade, the story of Facebook’s growth seemed like a positive (for Facebook) feedback loop: More users meant more conversation, which meant more relevance, which meant more users. The service became a kind of social power grid, a platform that you simply couldn’t not be on. It became fashionable among tech writers to claim that Facebook was subsuming the entire internet, if it hadn’t done so already. Optimism about Facebook’s impact on the world was an important part of the cycle. Everything about its sunny rhetoric, its design (clean and spare), its policies (real names, no pseudonyms), was finely calibrated to make people embrace it as the safe and upbeat alternative to the seedy world of the open web. When Facebook became a publicly held company in 2012, its I.P.O. prospectus included a long letter from Zuckerberg about Facebook’s values, in which he declared that the company was “built to accomplish a social mission” and that connecting the world would ultimately bring about “better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time.” It wasn’t hard to glimpse, lurking behind the strained smiles and flag-draping of the Georgetown speech, the death throes of that Facebook dream. The chief executive was forced to admit that his platform, far from solving social problems, had given rise to some thorny ones of its own. In his bracing rhetoric about the rise of the Chinese internet, you could even see the contours of Zuckerberg’s nightmare — of the virtuous cycle becoming a vicious one, with the gravitational pull of Facebook reversing, spinning its billions of users and their monetizable conversations out of his platform and inexorably toward China, toward despotism, toward dystopia: a TikTok of a boot stamping on a human face, forever. In this special Tech & Design Issue of The New York Times Magazine, we ponder the internet’s future at a time when that future has never felt more unsettled. It isn’t just about Facebook and the other American tech giants, which no longer enjoy the rapid growth that characterized their early days. The rise of the Chinese internet has threatened a geopolitical power shift, as a different government and national economy looks poised to become the center of the online world. Even governments that don’t “censor” the internet have begun to talk about regulating it in unprecedented ways — as with the European Union’s G.D.P.R. law, which already has given a huge swath of the developed world a subtly different set of online rules. But perhaps the deepest shift has been a shift in attitudes: the breaking of a spell that seemed to protect Silicon Valley from distrust. After years in which questions about online privacy hardly penetrated the consumer consciousness, Americans have awakened to a feeling of deep suspicion about how companies are harvesting and using their data. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll earlier this year found that American adults, by double-digit margins, believed that social media does more to spread falsehoods than truths and more to divide the country than to unite it. Even the tech giants’ own employees have now become uneasy about the implications of their work, leading to some unusual labor movements among their highly compensated white-collar ranks. If all this disappointment seems so acute, it’s only in contrast to the unrealistic hopes that the internet grew up on, long before Mark Zuckerberg showed up. From the earliest days of Arpanet, the internet has been seen as embodying an ambitious, even utopian set of values. It’s supposed to be open and global (such that anyone can plug in, anywhere) and also equal (in that every node should be able to get the same things). Even as the internet quickly morphed from a (mostly) public-funded (mostly) academic project into a (mostly) corporate-funded profit center, the power of those core values persisted. It persisted because those values have proved to be extremely profitable, at least for those who understand how to profit from them. People like Marc Andreessen, who took what he learned developing a web browser at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and helped found a company, Netscape, that went public and eventually was sold to America Online for $4.2 billion; and Mark Zuckerberg, whose company allows all those “voices” to get attention free but makes a mint by selling them, and their personal data, to advertisers. In retrospect, Zuckerberg’s letter in that 2012 Facebook prospectus was the high-water mark of internet boosterism, and it in fact encompassed most of the dreams that had attached themselves to the internet over the previous decades. References to Gutenberg’s printing press? Check. Denouncing of “monolithic, top-down” mind-sets, coming from the chief executive of a huge corporation? Check. A sense that effecting broad-based social change and becoming fabulously rich are goals that go hand in hand? For sure: “I’ve developed a deep appreciation for how building a strong company with a strong economic engine and strong growth can be the best way to align many people to solve important problems.” Intimations that tech will topple authoritarian rulers around the world? It’s in there: “Over time, we expect governments will become more responsive to issues and concerns raised directly by all their people rather than through intermediaries controlled by a select few.” As the technology critic Evgeny Morozov noted in his trenchant 2013 book, “To Save Everything, Click Here,” the distance between the quotidian reality of the internet and the utopian set of notions we projected onto it had become so vast that quotation marks ought to separate the idealized version from the real thing. “The internet” was going to empower the masses, overthrow hierarchies, build a virtual world that was far superior to the terrestrial one that bound us. But the actual internet was never capable of any of that, and once it fell into the hands of plutocrats and dictators, all the gauzy rhetoric around it only served their interests. By the same token, though, we might make the same observation about “the internet” that many people fear they’re bound up in today: Our dark new fantasies about it — with the puppet strings that stretch from the Kremlin to Palo Alto, making Grandpa dance to QAnon’s fiddle — are often just as ridiculous as the sunny visions they replaced. In this issue, we’ve tried to see the internet and its likely future as best we can, from as many angles as we can, in the hope that — after decades of imagining it as a utopia, and then years of seeing it as a dystopia — we might finally begin to see it for what it is, which is a set of powerful technologies in the midst of some serious flux. So the internet didn’t turn out the way we hoped. Now what? Arguably the most bracing reality about the internet today is that, after years of pretending that “the internet” means the same thing to all people everywhere, that fiction has finally become impossible to sustain. For the upper end of the income spectrum, a new suite of pay services promises to clean up the worst aspects of online life , even as the basic infrastructure of broadband and mobile remains highly unequal depending on where you live, both in America and around the world. And while Facebook and its fellow tech giants continue to loom over the American economy, through a business model that involves exploiting user data, their individual dreams of imperial expansion have brought them, collectively, to an awkward stalemate . At the same time, it’s crucial for Americans to realize, as Zuckerberg now seems to, that the internet is no longer as American as it once was. Government censorship and other interventions are only entrenching an online reality in which different nations are seeing very different internets , even different sets of facts. In China, a parallel and growing mobile-based internet doesn’t just portend a more censored online future; it’s offering up whole new ways to structure and order online life , with possible consequences that are scary in some ways and egalitarian in others. Perhaps the most profound force at work upon the internet right now is the simple passage of time. Everyone raised in a pre-internet era continues to age and disappear, while new generations grow up not merely as “digital natives” but as lifelong witnesses to the internet’s best and worst effects. In the naïve dreams of earlier days, many people joined Zuckerberg in imagining that connecting the world could bring about new social virtues at no social cost. But it’s now clear that interconnection by its very nature also brings about confounding new social situations, whether it’s the problem of disinformation seeded and spread by organized propagandists or the mind-bendingly obsessive culture of online fandom . For teenagers today, the internet is both a stage onto which to step boldly and a minefield through which to step gingerly — a double bind that has given rise to whole new habits of living online, in which self-expression and self-protection are inextricably linked . The passage of time, it’s clear, has been weighing even on Zuckerberg — a fact evident in what was, without a doubt, the most eye-opening moment in his Georgetown speech. “Building this institution is important to me personally,” he said, late in his oration, “because I’m not always going to be here, and I want to ensure that these values of voice and free expression are enshrined deeply into how this company is governed.” Not always going to be here? This 35-year-old, multibillionaire chief executive, with an ownership vice-grip that essentially guarantees he can remain atop Facebook for as long as he chooses, was raising the specter of his retirement, or perhaps even his death. Those concerns are surely premature, but neither would it be surprising if the impermanence of human existence were on Zuckerberg’s mind right now. Facebook and its chief executive might both hold on for decades, but the vision of the internet they represented — sunny, American, all-devouring — is already dead and gone. What, exactly, is arising to take its place? It’s complicated. Read on.

John Herrman,"Any suggestion that Big Tech has had a rough time must contend with this fact: Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, spent the past decade growing much faster than the rest of the economy. Whatever reckonings they’ve faced so far, and whatever backlash they’ve endured — in the press, on Capitol Hill — have been easily absorbed in financial terms. These ostensibly embattled firms recorded billions of dollars in profits, and can reasonably expect to continue to do so. It has been a great worst year ever, and next year is promising to be pretty good, too, as well as much, much worse. The tech giants haven’t been considered start-ups for years, and in some cases decades. They’re no mere incumbents, either; they’re some of the biggest companies in the world. But it’s not enough to simply take their measurements. They’re diversified conglomerates whose power is greater than even their staggering user numbers suggest. They were expansionary powers, chasing and luring new customers by the hundreds of millions, laying claim to territory and souls with the zeal of missionary explorers. What they’ve become are superpowers, whose imperative for growth has been replaced with a need to fortify, ally and extract. Reaching a billion users is a successful conquest; keeping them, and turning their continued allegiance into lasting power, is empire. This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. Google is much more than a search engine; Amazon is much more than a simple e-commerce site. This alone complicates the idea of competition. To comprehensively take on Facebook’s expanding coalition of megaservices is implausible; the best a competitor can do is create some sort of service that might steal away time or advertising dollars. Testifying before two Senate committees in 2018, Mark Zuckerberg was asked about his company’s biggest competitor. He struggled to name one, instead gesturing vaguely at “the other tech platforms,” including Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. “We overlap with them in different ways,” he said, answering as if the question were flawed. Competition is something you do in a market you share with others; it is, in the Facebook investor and board member Peter Thiel’s words, “for losers.” Overlap is what might occur when sovereign powers happen to occupy the same space, or lay claims to the same populations in the normal course of conquest. The tech giants, in becoming tech superpowers, have been growing in every direction beneath our feet, becoming tangled in ways that we cannot easily see and, together, improvising a new world order that is increasingly hard to route around, or to escape. To use the internet, in 2019, is to engage to some degree with the handful of private entities that control it. To start an internet company is to submit to one or many of them from the start. We, and the rest of the internet between us and them, are but subjects on the surface of a planet they’ve fully colonized and terraformed. Unfortunately for us, theirs are empires we’re stuck with for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately for them, they’re also stuck with one another. At the dawn of our new century, the web was still relatively federated — a messy, sprawling network of sites and services, some serving millions of users, some just a few. Google was still a search engine, Amazon was best known for selling books and Mark Zuckerberg was in high school. This web never fully lived up to its boosters’ ideals of free, mutually beneficial cooperation, of open standards and citizen empowerment, but it was closer than today’s internet. It was built by, and for, people used to accessing networks through computers; for all its professions of freedom and open access, this web was exclusive by default, rooted firmly in an era in which digital participation was economically and socially limited. But whatever else this web was, it was spacious. The internet is now mobile — available almost anywhere — which has significantly expanded the user base and use cases for all sorts of services: You can buy from Amazon while standing in a Walmart, or check Instagram while you’re watching TV. In the past decade, there was also a wholesale migration of online services to a small group of conglomerate hosting companies, from which start-ups and venerable tech firms alike can rent space and computing power instead of investing in costly, and ultimately inferior, physical infrastructure themselves. On their own, each of these trends is, at most, an airport book. Welcome to the mobile revolution! Allow me to introduce you to network effects. As I’m sure you know, The Cloud is the future, and you’d better get to elevation, fast! The ways in which these trends have combined, however, have produced the peculiar results that have actually reordered things. It’s a simple question, and a maddeningly squirrelly one to answer — though that doesn’t keep economists and advocates from trying. Here we lay out two models: a straightforward one from the Democratic strategy group Future Majority; and a second from data scientists and economists at Microsoft, whose much higher figure comes from the expectation that our future economy will be driven by artificial intelligence that depends on harvesting oodles and oodles of our data to drive its machine learning. Either model, of course, raises an intriguing further question: How much of that bounty should flow to you? THE STATUS QUO MODEL $198 billion: Projected total data-derived revenues in 2022 in the U.S. across four major categories: internet platforms, large-scale data brokers and credit card and health care companies. (Up from $52.5 billion in 2016 and $76 billion in 2018.) 321 million: Projected total number of internet users among the U.S. population in 2022. $616.82: Per capita annual bounty per internet user. THE A.I. ACCELERATOR MODEL $7.1 trillion: Microsoft's Glen Weyl begins with an estimate that by 2030, A.I.-driven production will account for as much as a third of the U.S. G.D.P. Applying that to a projected G.D.P. in 2019 of $21.5 trillion yields $7.1 trillion. 329.9 million: Current U.S. population. $21,522: Per capita A.I.-driven G.D.P. The death of the relatively open web , the rise of mobile phones and centralized app stores, the consolidation of media consumption around megascale intermediaries — all of these trends helped to establish what is now the internet’s reigning business model. What emerged is a tech industry that exaggerates the ugliest features of the global economy in which it operates: crushing consolidation of power by an ever smaller number of dominant firms; stratified marketplaces supported by precarious laborers; sector domination as table stakes. The victors in this process captured enormous amounts of attention and capital along the way, which the savviest among them immediately used for — what else? — aggressive, multilateral expansion. A result is that the largest companies in the Western tech sector don’t operate on the internet so much as they are synonymous with it. The rise of TikTok, the Chinese-owned social app, is an object lesson in the consequences of this arrangement. To a casual observer, it seemed to explode in the manner of a viral sensation, but in reality, it found many of its Western users through an advertising campaign that cost hundreds of millions of dollars in a single year , much of which went straight to American social-media giants — nominally TikTok’s competitors, but also gatekeepers to an unimaginably massive audience. Or ask Netflix, the leading video-streaming company in the United States, the kind of firm that might be confused for a superpower itself, if not for the fact that it outsources “nearly all its computing and storage needs,” in Amazon’s words , to Amazon, which has a video-streaming service of its own, with tens of millions of viewers and its own shelves of entertainment-industry awards. These, it should be said, are success stories. TikTok gained access to its audience, which it can now try to leverage into money and new forms of influence (though it has recently drawn scrutiny not just from the United States government but from Facebook, which has hosted ads for the service). Netflix doesn’t have to maintain an unwieldy and expensive infrastructure of its own, and is the streaming service to beat (although it recently reported losing users in the U.S. for the first time in eight years). This is how the internet business works now: If you need to access new populations, you have to deal with Facebook, and buy your way in. If you need to build a new tech company from scratch, you’re going to need to make a deal with one of the empires that has secured access to certain valuable resources. Have a product to sell? Good luck hitting your goals without listing your wares on Amazon, or without setting up a storefront in Apple’s and Google’s app marketplaces. The paths to all but the largest websites run through Google’s territory, which is expanding by the day. The app stores are monuments to the smartphone boom, a gold rush that defined an era — sprawling, peerless capitals through which astonishing volumes of people, products and time pass under the watchful eyes of Apple’s and Google’s bureaucracies. If it’s still possible to exist online outside the territorial boundaries of these tech empires, it’s nearly impossible not to engage them at all. What little space that remains untouched by the tech empires is still menaced by them. To be online, as a business or as an individual, is to accept their premises or demands. What you end up with is situations like that of Pinterest: a well-known brand that reports to having 300 million monthly users, an online destination, as well as a tool that maps over the rest of the web — another success story. This same Pinterest, however, exists at the mercy of companies that may not think of it as a primary competitor but would not hesitate to release a competing product. In its investor prospectus, this Pinterest listed its competitors as “larger, more established companies such as Amazon, Facebook (including Instagram), Google, Snap and Twitter.” Elsewhere it listed many of those same companies as risk factors: Google can, and it claims has already, limited visitors to Pinterest through search; Facebook and Google can be used to sign into Pinterest, and changes to Facebook’s login system have already “negatively impacted” user growth and engagement; Pinterest depends on Amazon to host “the vast majority” of its operation, and is committed to spending at least $750 million with the firm over the next four years. Imagine, if you will, a huge warehouse. It has a raised floor and thousands of identical metal racks holding dozens of servers and switches apiece: A few hundred thousand square feet speckled with blinking lights and filled with the whir of cooling fans and climate control. This hyperscale data center is what runs the internet, our banking infrastructure, our casinos and our increasingly complex mobile digital lives. And they’re growing like gangbusters, both in number and size. A year ago there were 449 hyperscale centers in the world; today there are 504, with the biggest topping out at millions of square feet. Or maybe you use Spotify, the music-streaming app that can credibly claim to have changed how millions of people listen to music as well as what it means to be a professional musician. It’s an enormously successful operation, practically a generic trademark for music streaming. More than 248 million people around the world use it, and 113 million pay for it, according to the company. But there’s another way of looking at Spotify, and it makes the service look somewhat thinner. It’s not just that the company is an intermediary between listeners and content that it doesn’t own, though that is true: Spotify, like all but the very largest tech companies, relies on another company — in this case, Google — to host most of its infrastructure. When you hit play on a Spotify song, something happens on servers owned by Google, a privilege and action for which Spotify pays a fee. And for a time after its U.S. launch, in 2011, the only way to sign up for it was by using a Facebook account. Some 70 percent of users access it through an app installed on Apple and Android devices, through app stores run by Apple and Google, each of which has music-streaming services of its own, with comparable pricing and features to the ones Spotify made standard years before. Spotify got its users with Facebook’s help, owns neither the material that it sells or advertises against and in fact negotiates for rights to it alongside much richer competitors that count Spotify as a client. It might be a stretch to attribute Spotify’s success to Facebook’s largess, or to describe app stores as charitable, but these much more powerful companies have created the conditions in which a company like Spotify has been able to thrive, relatively speaking. In a complaint Spotify filed against Apple with the European Commission, which contends that the App Store policies and fee structures place competitors at a disadvantage to Apple’s own music-streaming services, the company stops short of contending that Apple is deliberately sabotaging its business, or stealing its customers; it simply notes that the conditions created by a world in which Apple has so much power will produce an indistinguishable outcome. Apple responded publicly by suggesting its operations amount to more than just a company; it’s an entire economy whose success corresponds with the success of its numerous clients, or partners, or participants, or whatever everyone else is. “Spotify seeks to keep all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem,” it said, “without making any contributions to that marketplace.” All Apple wants to do, it went on, is “grow the pie.” Such lopsided relationships as Apple and Spotify’s provide a preview of the way much bigger conflicts might emerge in the future. The genuine tech empires have always been in competition, but until recently they’ve always had plenty of room to expand in different directions. There were plenty of users to go around, and plenty of ways to make money from each of them. Amazon could dominate retail and hosting. Facebook could dominate social advertising. Google could keep its control over search and mapping and online video, through which it manages a massive advertising marketplace. Their collective success enlarged the tech industry as a whole and created new opportunities within it, as well as nearby. When imperial ambition came into direct contact — such as when Google tried to launch its Google Plus social network, or when Facebook tried to create a smartphone platform — failures were softened by continued expansion elsewhere. It was a prosperous era for those that were a part of it; less so for any company, or industry, or system, that happened to be in the way. (See: retail; media; democracy.) Everything was growing, and future growth was limitless. Among the American tech superpowers, creeping interdependence has likewise been accepted as a necessary, and even desirable, component of a new digital order. But the end of explosive growth, combined with external pressures stemming in part from the worldwide turn against globalization, will illuminate the ways in which the tech giants have power over one another, and how tenuous are the situations of their smaller proxy states. Annual internet traffic is projected by Cisco to hit 4.8 zettabytes of data per year by 2022. Video traffic is driving most of the growth, and will account for 82 percent of all internet traffic by 2022. The total footprint (est.): 125 million square feet = 2,170 football fields. According to IDC, by 2025, stored data worldwide will total 175 zettabytes = the storage capacity of ~1.75 billion human brains. The manners in which the tech empires are entangled are occasionally absurd. Apple is currently being sued for supposedly misrepresenting its iCloud product to customers, who may have assumed they were buying storage for their personal photos solely on Apple’s own servers. Apple, the suit contends, had also built iCloud on top of other companies’ cloud services: namely Amazon’s AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. In other cases, such interdependence has spilled into conflict. On multiple occasions, Apple has suspended apps created or owned by Facebook for breaking its policies — once even revoking Facebook’s ability to test apps internally , which, among other things, rendered thousands of employees’ phones, all full of nonpublic company apps, temporarily useless. They didn’t touch Facebook’s consumer-facing apps, which provide Facebook with nearly exclusive access to the hundreds of millions of people who use the service, and see its ads, in iOS. But the implication was clear: It could if it wanted to; Apple and Facebook are only partners, or allies, as long as both parties agree. Facebook could escalate, too, if it wanted, by removing all of its apps from iOS, and preventing Apple users from easily accessing its services. This would be disastrous for Apple, but probably more disastrous for Facebook — and most disastrous for the user who expected to be able to use WhatsApp to talk with her family back home, who then could not. The recent attempts of Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, to position Apple as a privacy-forward company, at Facebook’s expense, might sound like grandstanding from the outside, but within Facebook they’re heard loud and clear: Apple believes it is in a position to make demands. The American tech superpowers are running out of new users to sign up in their mature markets. But more worrying, for them, is the accelerating collapse of their prospects for expansion into some major international markets — particularly China, and countries where Chinese tech companies are snatching up territory of their own. This is a significant revision to their outlooks from just 10 years ago, when they could blithely envision the acquisition of the “next billion” users as nothing more than a matter of engineering resources and time. Now that they can no longer forecast forever growth, the risk of open conflict among these companies in the future seems much higher. Apple and Amazon, for example, might have liked to dominate music streaming — who wouldn’t? — but they never needed to destroy Spotify. Apple was making plenty of money every year selling phones, and Amazon’s main line of business has been growing monstrously, and there were always more markets to expand to anyway. But what happens after a few years of slow growth, when secondary businesses like music streaming suddenly need to make more money? Even bigger conflicts are possible. It might be unwise, but it would not be impossible, for Amazon to weaponize its hosting services — declaring that it wouldn’t work with firms it considered competitors, or which provide services that “overlap” with its own. (Jeff Bezos’s ownership may have already been weaponized against him, if indeed the Pentagon’s unlikely selection of Microsoft for a $10 billion cloud-computing contract resulted from President Trump’s issues with the C.E.O.) Like any advertising provider, Google and Facebook can choose whom they do business with. What if they declined to accept advertising money from the next social app based in China? (Or what if they were just told to do so by the American government?) As users — as subjects — we’re not even party to these disputes. What vanishingly little power we did have, to somehow vote with our wallets on services that we generally don’t pay for, is narrowed each time another winner takes all, leaving us with nowhere else to go. We’ve only ever known these empires during periods of expansion. What happens when they run out of land to conquer, and people to claim as their own? How do they rule, and when do they go to war?

But They’re Stuck With Each Other.,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/13/magazine/internet-platform.html
Elizabeth Weil,"On April 26, 2018, a 15-year-old named Antonio Garza sat in front of her mirror in her bedroom in Austin, Tex., turned on her phone and started talking to herself as she did her makeup. She had long, curly brown hair that she wished were straight, almost no nails at all and a red, irritated upper lip — she didn’t really know why her lip was red, it just was — and she displayed all this for the camera. “I’m dying — finally!” Antonio said, and for the next 20 minutes she oscillated like the teenager that she is, a kind of excited electron, bouncing between one shell of identity and the next: pimply high school freshman, femme glam diva, vulnerable diarist, camera-ready ham. Throughout, she flicked across her face dozens of makeup brushes and powders, creating cut-creases on her eyelids and contours on her cheekbones and nose, then applying fake eyelashes fluffy as kittens. As she did all this, she monologued about how she thought she was going to do a makeup channel but decided she didn’t want to do a makeup channel. “I need to not be annoying, and I’m not doing a good job at that,” Antonio said, cheerfully. “I also look ugly, and I’m really depressed!” Forty-five minutes later, tender, glittering and shellacked in cosmetics, she was ready for school. This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. A year earlier, in eighth grade, Antonio spent most of her time playing oboe and Fortnite, hanging out alone in her room and making mistakes with her eyebrows. This sounds as if it would be lame, and it was, in fact, lame. But being a depressed kid alone in your room is not what it used to be. It’s one thing to be depressed and listen to the Smiths in your oversize Champion sweatshirt and write in your journal and then hide that journal away and come out and pretend you have your act together. It’s another thing to be a depressed kid alone in your room in your oversize Champion sweatshirt and then make some videos that toggle back and forth, back and forth, between “I’m not thriving at all right now” and “Actually I just slayed”; between using Final Cut Pro to distort your face into the shape of a waterlogged Mr. Potato Head and creating a military-grade defense shield of foundation and bronzer. That is to say, to be a gender-bending kid alone in your room making videos that capture exactly what it feels like to be a teenager right now, the whole multipolar mess of humanity deep inside your own brain, and then post those videos to YouTube even though what you’ve just expressed to your smartphone you probably would not say to your mother in the kitchen and definitely would not say to your classmates, all of whom (you believe, wrongly) think you’re really weird. Later that afternoon, her hair now up in a ponytail, Antonio returned to her room and apologized to her 30 YouTube subscribers for being such a failure because she’d forgotten to vlog at school. Or really, she said, she hadn’t forgotten to vlog at school. She just hadn’t wanted to vlog at school because in every situation in her seven-hour school day, she felt uncomfortable. Also, she said, staring at the floor, she looked terrible. Which maybe you couldn’t tell in this lighting. But if you could tell and you were thinking of writing “You’re ugly” in the comments below — Antonio paused and stared into the camera, open as a wound. “Don’t,” she said. “Please.” She titled the video “Ninth Grade Makeup Transformation” and uploaded it to YouTube. Then nothing happened. Or at least nothing happened for a few days. Then right before finals week of her freshman year, Antonio’s phone start blowing up with notifications. On Sunday, May 13, 2018, Antonio reached 10,000 YouTube subscribers. By May 22, she had more than 100,000, and by May 31, 300,000. Kids started sending her screenshots of her face on their YouTube recommendation pages, saying: What the heck! I had no idea! Congrats! By then, thank God, school was out for summer vacation. Antonio hung out in her room making even more videos — digitally widening her brow and narrowing her chin until she looked like the alien E.T.; installing over her dark irises a pair of light blue contacts; slowing down her voice to lower it three octaves; taking mortifying trips to Target, where everybody stared at her; sharing how to get un-ugly tutorials that “include so many steps you might want to die”; saying: “I’m funny, I’m not funny at all. So that’s funny. It’s actually I’m funny though. …” By the time school reopened for Antonio’s sophomore year, she had a million YouTube subscribers, and it was basically impossible for her to attend. Because you can’t be a YouTuber and go to a big public school. You just can’t. Emma Chamberlain, who is 18 and who some say created the jumpy editing style Antonio now does better, dropped out. The Dolan twins, who are now 19 and who after five years of filming every aspect of their lives, including wisdom-teeth extractions, just announced that they were going to stop uploading weekly for the sake of their mental health, dropped out before her. As Antonio explained to me, to high schoolers YouTubers are the equivalent of mainstream celebrities. Each morning when she walked on campus, the same kids who ignored her for years suddenly wanted to take selfies with her in the courtyard. And the same kids she’d known forever, kids who had been in her gym class or played with her in middle-school band, were like, Do you remember me? You probably don’t remember me. And Antonio was like, Um, I’ve known you since we were 6. One day this past spring, I entered my home office to find that my 14-year-old had written ANTONIO GARZA on my whiteboard in small red letters. I texted her at school to ask why. “I thought it would be funny for u to watch one of her videos,” she wrote back. “Cuz ur old.” (She added, “jk, I love you.” Nice.) My daughter’s entertainment philosophy — not incorrect — was, and still is, that TV is primarily made by old people for old people and thus is irrelevant to her. YouTube, on the other hand, at least the part of it she sees, is made by teenagers for teenagers. And not just that, it’s made by teenagers talking to themselves in private, broadcasting their boredom-laced secret diaries, promising (and at moments, delivering) remote intimacy. This made watching those videos low-key compelling, good background for texting your friends or doing homework (if you were not inclined just to cue up a four-hour video of a person studying, which is now a thing). My daughter also found Antonio “relatable,” a huge buzzword among teenage YouTubers these days. “Is this what your brain feels like?” I asked. She said yes. Then she added, more knowingly than I might have liked: “You don’t think in one constant line of thought.” She meant both me specifically and humans in general. “My brain could never.” Meme accounts have taken over Instagram. According to Instagram, meme content is shared seven times more than nonmeme content on the service. The pages have grown so widespread that Instagram is hiring a meme-account liaison to work with such accounts. In 2016, Samir Mezrahi founded @KaleSalad , a tremendously popular meme account with more than 3.4 million followers. If you’re looking to start an account of your own, he has a few tips. 1. No interest is too niche. “You’ll be more successful if you make memes that are related to your interests. That could be your high school, your high school teams, cars, travel, you can focus on a movie, or show, or character — like Shrek.” 2. Straightforward handles are best. “You can have your interest and add ‘memes’ at the end of the handle; try to keep it as clear as possible. A lot of accounts have the words ‘zar,’ ‘plug,’ ‘memes’: You can add variations if your original name isn’t available. Kale Salad was a meme in itself back when I got it. Now it’s an old meme and kind of a dead meme, but it still works.” 3. Fake tweets and viral images are eternal. “A good genre of meme is when you tap into whatever the viral image of the moment is and make it your thing. One genre of meme uses the tweet format. That’s caption on the top and one or two images below; sometimes there’s text on the images. People digest that format well.” 4. Be shameless. “After you post your first meme, you have to promote it. Every time you post, you should share it to your Instagram Stories. You need to tell people to follow you and check out your account. You can use some hashtags to start. Try to get anyone in your existing network to check out your account. And be consistent. A lot of people don’t post enough; you can post a few times a day.” 5. Go private. “Going private is a fun growth hack. You set your account to private because D.M.s are a popular thing on Instagram. Friends D.M. each other memes, and when your account is set to private, the person you send it to can’t see them, so it forces them to follow you to see the meme.'' Later in the summer, this same child introduced me to JoJo Siwa , another 16-year-old denizen of the internet. JoJo achieved some fame as a star on the reality-TV show “Dance Moms” but became a megastar online, just as herself. Or really an avatar of herself. Her persona is deliriously, dementedly plastic and flat, a 6-year-old beauty-pageant princess rolled out in a pasta machine. While Antonio circumscribes vast swaths of the human experience pinballing around her six-dimensional universe — guileless/sophisticated; earnest/glib; confident/troubled; boyish/girlish; accomplished/bumbling; thriving/morose — JoJo seems to emerge from a deep youth internet mind-set that we’re all Bitmoji-ed, filtered and served up on tiny screens anyway, so why even bother pretending you’re warmblooded and whole? The result is horrifying to just about everybody who is not a child or a teenager, including Justin Bieber (who in the not-so-distant past committed his own teenage culture crimes). Last December, JoJo posted on Instagram an image of herself with a new car: a white BMW with a custom paint job that featured rainbows, sparkles, hearts and a gigantic airbrushed photo of her face. Bieber commented, “Burn it.” (Later, he apologized, and JoJo asked him to play at her 16th-birthday party; he didn’t.) My 17-year-old daughter, in contrast, watched Jeffree Star , a sort of adult male goth drag version of JoJo who joined YouTube in 2006 and currently sells $100 million worth of his cosmetics annually, and whose own identity is such a deliberately plastic work of self-creation that he has had injections, surgery and other procedures on his lips, forehead, nose, teeth and hair. She even watched videos of a fellow YouTube megacelebrity, Shane Dawson, interviewing Jeffree Star while made up and dressed up as Jeffree Star, the two of them in platinum blond wigs and matching $1,850 Gucci tracksuits. I found this vertigo-inducing unless I viewed it as campy, Escher-inspired video art. But to my daughter it was a relief: Dawson and Star offered their fans the knowledge that you could put on just about any persona you wanted with little or no risk, as with a costume change and some cosmetics-removing wipes, you could simply make that persona go away. You could test out look after look after look, possibility after possibility. One minute your inner diva; the next, your inner nerd. You could treat the whole exercise as ironic. Or experiment with radical sincerity, knowing you could retreat into the safe waters of cynicism if the embarrassment grew too hot. My daughter found this comforting, even counterintuitively stabilizing. “Every morning I go in the bathroom at school, and everybody is putting on makeup, and everybody is changing out of the clothes they wore for their mom,” she told me. “Like literally every morning. And everyone is saying, ‘This is the ugliest I’ve ever been,’ or, ‘I look like I’m in a punk-rock band,’ or, ‘I look like I’m an e-boy.’ It’s just like cognitive dissonance.” It is also just like the human experience. Especially at age 16. Antonio always knew a few things about herself. She knew she wanted to have long, straight hair, and she knew she wanted to wear so much makeup and just be like, essentially, perfect. She didn’t want to look like her mom — she loves her mom, and her mom is beautiful, but no, absolutely not, she told me. But neither did she want to be like her dad or her older brother. When she was younger, she was into princess dresses, art and eye shadow, and she knew she expressed herself “differently from really, like, everybody I went to school with.” She didn’t cohere in one tidy prefab identity package. And she didn’t really care. Antonio also always knew she wanted to be a YouTuber and do makeup tutorials. But when she actually started doing them, she also realized she wanted to do makeup tutorials and not talk about makeup. By 2018, this was a viable, scrutable social enterprise, in the same way that it became a viable enterprise for Jon Stewart to make comedy shows that were no longer focused on comedy. “People will look at this and say, ‘Oh, this is beauty content — like, the purpose of this content is for people to learn beauty tips,’ ” Kevin Allocca, YouTube’s head of culture and trends, told me. But the truth is, once people who grew up watching makeup tutorials began creating their own makeup tutorials, the form started to morph. “You peel back a layer, and the beauty stuff becomes this convention that allows you to have another set of interactions and discussions.” In response to her sudden fame, Antonio gave up a little — on looks, on life — and started wearing almost no makeup to school except fake eyelashes (and yes, she knows some people think it’s a big deal to wear lashes to school, but they take her only three minutes and they make her look more presentable, so). Her grades also fell into the dumpster. At that point, her mother relented and let her enroll in online school. Holed up in her room for even more hours a day, Antonio kept making videos. In them, her mother occasionally reaches an arm into Antonio’s bedroom and deposits a mug of tea on her bureau. Or Antonio orders Taco Bell. Or Antonio rotates through Wagner’s entire Ring Cycle of emotions while dying her hair pink . The dramas are grand, banal, earnest and unapologetically boring. Antonio then edits them with frantic cuts, subtitles introducing bald sincerity (“I am not O.K.”), X-ray filters, horror genre music and satirical product placement that is also product placement. “I’m like, Oh, this is what happens when someone is raised on the internet,” one 23-year-old friend said to me when I asked him to explain, “like this person grew up thinking in GIFs.” The result is sui generis — relatable and a relief, yes, to the young, but also panic-inducing. We all know we’re disjointed schizoid selves deep inside, yet aren’t we supposed to leave these selves in the bathroom mirror? Antonio insists that she’s the same in person as she is online, and it’s true. On a Thursday morning this fall when she opened the front door to her very decorated-for-Halloween house, she was dressed in an oversize T-shirt that covered her shorts, and we sat and talked in her bedroom while she did her makeup. Antonio was feeling a little overwhelmed. She was behind in physics, and behind in calculus, and she knew she needed to grind so she did not fail her classes and get kicked out of online school. But at the same time she needed to post to Instagram . This was a professional, not emotional, need: That day she was releasing “merch,” big black cotton sweatshirts with a single small orange pumpkin embroidered on the front. But posting on Instagram was stressful, like really so stressful, because if a post didn’t receive that many likes — which for Antonio was between zero and 600,000 — then Antonio felt bad about it and wanted to delete it. But deleting a post also looked bad, because it revealed that you cared a pathetic amount about what other people thought. (If a post receives between 650,000 and 900,000 likes, Antonio will keep it up; she can always tell within 10 minutes, honestly five minutes, how a post is going to perform.) So after Antonio finished her look — pink half cut-creases around her eyes, glinting contours on her cheeks, nose and upper lip — and misted her face with setting spray, she moved over to her unmade bed to Facetune her photos. “I know some YouTubers who will post pictures of themselves taken straight from their phones, and they’re doing fine,” Antonio said. “They’re probably mentally doing amazing.” But she has a process: First, she gets rid of her acne. Then she color-corrects her neck, removes flyaway hairs, narrows her jawline, straightens her nose, plumps her lips — digital, as opposed to analog, cosmetics, essentially. Then she moves the image over to the VSCO app to use its filters. “I’m not a VSCO girl,” she said. “Well, maybe I am.” Part of the terror of the internet, for the olds, is that this technology exploits flaws in our thinking. Pre-internet, the prevailing belief was that we had real selves and fake selves, and we cast judgment on the fakes. We took for granted that we should at least try to present ourselves to the world as coherent people with unified personalities. An avatar could only mean trouble (and often did): an alter ego, an outlet, for the excised bits; a convenient, nearly irresistible portal for the parts of ourselves we had repressed. This foundational (maybe Puritan?) belief in the integrated self has been helpful, even necessary, in real life, because in real life we need to deal with one another in time and space. Thus it’s nice if our fellow humans are predictable, and you have some idea of what you’ll be dealing with when a person shows up. There are whole branches of psychology dedicated to trying to help us keep ourselves together. And, of course, rafts of diagnoses — bipolar, schizophrenia, multiple personality, borderline personality — for those of us who fail to do this well. And yet, at the same time, we know it’s a ruse. We are, all of us, deeply, inalienably contradictory and chaotic. In the practical world, we pretend it’s not true. But in art, if people capture this multidimensionality beautifully enough — “Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself” — we herald their genius and praise them for it. This chaos — this cubism, this unleashing of our multiple selves — is a feature, not a bug, of the online world. It’s arguably its defining characteristic for those who grew up there. You could attribute all the jump cuts, all the endlessly iterating memes, to a destroyed attention span. But it’s also evidence of something deeper, a mind-set people are just trying to name. The Dutch cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker settled on the term metamodernism , a cultural position they claim is defined by neither modernism’s essential optimism nor postmodernism’s irony and mistrust, but as an “oscillation, an unsuccessful negotiation, between two opposite poles.” The sensibility is, as Luke Turner, a British artist and the author of “The Metamodernist Manifesto,” puts it, “a kind of informed naïveté, a pragmatic idealism, a moderate fanaticism, oscillating between sincerity and irony, deconstruction and construction, apathy and affect, attempting to attain some sort of transcendent position, as if such a thing were within our grasp.” It is nostalgic and cynical, knowing and naïve; manipulative, manipulated and spontaneous. Arguably it is the dominant postapocalyptic vision of our digital times, the internet’s McLuhan moment, brought to us by teenagers who, as such, spend their days feeling like 10 different people at once and believe they can, and should, express them all. We all contain multitudes. The kids seem to know that’s all right. Elizabeth Weil is a writer at large for the magazine. She last wrote a profile of Venus Williams.

That Identity Is a Work in Progress,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/13/magazine/internet-teens.html
Suzy Hansen,"On Saturday, April 29, 2017, Turkey banned Wikipedia. This came as a shock, even in a country with a history of banning everything from novels (Albert Camus’s “The Plague,” from public schools in 1987) to films (“Nymphomaniac,” in 2014) to entire genres of music ( arabesk , from state channels in the ’70s and ’80s). Previously, Turkey’s checks on the Turkish-language version of Wikipedia were limited to blocking only specific entries — like “vagina,” “human penis” and “2015 Turkey general election polls.” Someone in Turkey who followed a link to such a page would simply find it didn’t work. But why did the whole thing have to go? Syria, it turned out, was the proximate inspiration. Wikipedia pages with headers like “State-sponsored terrorism” and “Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War” seemed to accuse the Turkish government of supporting ISIS — “a smear campaign,” according to officials. Some months later, after the full block went into effect, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz identified other entries that the government considered offensive: One was about 57,000 emails tied to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak, which implicated him in having had indirect business relationships with ISIS; another entry, about “Benevolent Dictators,” like Napoleon and Fidel Castro, included Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey’s founding father. The government said it was banning Wikipedia, according to the law that allowed it to do so, for the protection of public order or national security. This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. For many years, the government had been more ad hoc in its policing of the internet. Then in 2007, Turkey’s Parliament, controlled by the still-young A.K. Party, passed a law numbered 5651, or “Regulation of Publications on the Internet and Suppression of Crimes Committed by Means of Such Publication.” Yaman Akdeniz, a Turkish cyberlaw expert, has noted that it passed after only 59 minutes of discussion. Around that time, one of the government’s many concerns was YouTube: Some users had reportedly said offensive things about Ataturk, including the claim that he was gay. When Turkish citizens complained about the insult — Penal Code Article 301 makes it a crime to insult Ataturk, Turkey or Turkishness — an Ankara court banned YouTube entirely. The president at the time, Abdullah Gul, would later tweet that he didn’t support the ban. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister, confessed that he had himself found ways to get on YouTube anyway. Those were the good old days. That was the era I moved to Turkey. The deep skepticism that many Turks had toward their institutions — courts, police, politicians, newspapers — was apparent. Military regimes had been intervening in the country’s affairs for most of its existence, and despite democratically elected governments, a diverse media and outspoken artists and activists, the state always controlled some of the information in the country and persecuted those who defied its manipulation. Turks were used to wading through the propaganda, counterpropaganda and the heroic efforts of native truth tellers, sorting bits of insanity and logic into their respective mental bins. They had their own ways of judging whether a court ruling or a newspaper headline was accurate or fair: These depended on their previous knowledge of the traditions and biases of an institution, or on their politics, their sources of information, their common sense. Some fell prey or willingly succumbed to the official state line; those who rejected it were compelled to question everything, as if interrogating the very contours of reality. The Turks were perhaps more prepared than many to deal with two of the most bewildering new features of what is now our shared global predicament: the chaos of the internet and the populist subterfuge of one-man regimes. But in recent years, both have accelerated to a scary degree in Turkey. What was once a semi-predictable stranglehold on official information has become a chaotic, repressive race to protect Erdogan’s interests. Much of this repression is by now well known. Hundreds of journalists have been jailed or fled the country in fear; hundreds more abandoned the profession; there is no longer an independent media in Turkey, save for a few small newspapers and websites; fake news is rampant. But the scale of Erdogan’s censorship works in far more diverse and insidious ways than most outsiders will ever understand. Erdogan is on TV and the radio so often — even a quick pop-in for a container of milk at the store means having to hear his voice — that it is very likely many Turks get their news directly from his mouth. That leaves one public space where people in Turkey go to hash out the truth: the internet, though the Erdogan government has been doing its best to make it both a duller and more dangerous place. Turning points came in 2013 and 2014, when two events genuinely threatened Erdogan’s hold on power. The first was the Gezi Park protests, in which thousands of people all across the country demonstrated against environmental destruction and police violence; social media was often used to agitate for more dissent. The other was the release of taped recordings that seemed to expose the shady business practices of Erdogan and his allies. By 2014, the government’s requests to Twitter and Facebook to remove users’ accounts spiked. Following the attempted military coup in 2016, Turkey has become one of the world’s harsher regimes when it comes to internet censorship. Turks can be hounded on Twitter by violent pro-Erdogan trolls or be detained by the police for a tweet, for a Facebook post, for a joke, for a casual outburst that can be taken as “insulting” the president. The government censors whole websites and platforms at will. It has in the past shut down YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. According to a report produced by the Turkey-based Freedom of Expression Association, nearly 250,000 sites are inaccessible without virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, which get users around regional restrictions. In 2018, Turkey sent 1,105 court orders to Twitter, compared with Russia and Brazil, which sent 372 and 107 orders. Turkey has asked Google to remove content more than 9,000 times in the last 10 years. It was supposedly because Wikipedia repeatedly rebuffed requests to remove things that the government decided to ban the site completely. This past summer, Turkey gave its broadcasting ministry oversight of the entire internet, including sites like Netflix, as well as local Netflix analogues like PuhuTV and BlueTV. This time, it wasn’t Erdogan tapes or gibes against Ataturk that caused the panic; one of the causes for panic was homosexuality. Pro-government newspapers cited “Orange Is the New Black,” “Stranger Things,” “El Chapo,” “Narcos” and “Black Mirror” as troubling cheerleaders for homosexuality, even calling Netflix a purveyor of “moral terrorism.” The oversight means that even news sites may have to obtain operating licenses from the broadcasting ministry. The human rights lawyer Kerem Altiparmak called the move the “biggest step in Turkish censorship history.” Every country’s mode of censorship varies in both severity and focus, and every society has its own ways of dealing with it. Turkey is not China, where Twitter is banned (though defiantly used by a small community), and yet it is a place where someone can be arrested for a tweet. Turkey’s style of censorship reflects its weird authoritarian-democratic state of being: The president’s office controls much of Turkish life, and yet the Turkish people can vote his party out of office in a mayoral election. Turks can be detained by the police for a Facebook post, but Facebook still exists. The most insidious and damaging effect of this political purgatory is that many Turks may not even know what information they are missing. I don’t want to exaggerate the degree to which censorship in Turkey affects the daily search for facts. Turks can easily find everyday information: the size of an earthquake tremor, the source of a fire in a nearby neighborhood, the value of their often-depreciating lira. In 2016, they figured out in minutes that a military coup was underway. The internet is so vast that even if you censor one website, people can find an alternative one. This government’s censorship is now often focused on subject areas that threaten the government: the failing economy, expressions of sympathy for people linked to “terrorism,” claims of corruption — and anything to do with Erdogan’s family. In the past, the Turkish state had a greater ideology to uphold; Erdogan has made censorship also about himself. If a piece of news doesn’t suit him, his government sees no reason it should exist. For ordinary people who want the details on their leadership and the fate of their country, once a website or article is censored, blocked, otherwise disappeared, they must engage in cat-and-mouse games to find a still extant link or an alternative news source before those, too, are censored. After the Wikipedia ban went into effect, for example, the news spread quickly in Turkey that if you just typed a “0” or “1” before a Wikipedia link — 0wikipedia.org or 1wikipedia.org — you could still connect to the site. But this workaround game can also favor those who speak foreign languages and have money. Turks evade many bans with V.P.N.s, but they’re good only for those who can afford them or put up with the glitchiness of the cheaper ones. Turks might also seek out information on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Periscope, or their own local sites like Dogruluk Payi or Teyit, whose mission is to fact-check the news. They might resort to WhatsApp groups where, perhaps even semiconsciously, they crowdsource information and dissect the latest news themselves. For the past decade, the watchdog organization Freedom House has analyzed digital liberty in dozens of countries, now home to 87 percent of the world’s online population. Its 2019 report, published Nov. 5, found a continuing global trend of increasing internet oppression by the usual suspects — Russia and China — but also long-term declines in internet freedom in countries like France and the United States. Active Freedom Iceland and other countries that top the charts have laws that favor open discussion and protect users. Slow Erosion Several strong democracies, including the United States and France, have seen freedoms degrade over the past decade. In France, crackdowns on extremist websites followed terror attacks. Swing States India and other countries in the middle of the chart are figuring out their internet regulations and might move either way in the future. Digital Revolution In Sri Lanka and Gambia, new governments resulted in swift increases in freedoms. Shutdown Fights Russia experienced protests for blocking social platforms like Telegram, slowing the state’s curtailment. The China Model Recently, China has held censorship training sessions for international authorities, exporting its brand of internet repression to the world. One homegrown Turkish website, called Eksi Sozluk, which means Sour Dictionary, could be called the Turkish Wikipedia. (In fact, it appeared online two years before Wikipedia.) It differs from its more famous cousin in significant ways: Rather than allowing users to collectively edit one dictionary entry, it encourages select contributors to add whatever entry they want, in the form of a list. Eksi Sozluk’s founder, a self-taught programmer and former software engineer at Microsoft named Sedat Kapanoglu, once explained: “The ones who consume the information provide it themselves — something very different from what we had seen in our education life in Turkey. To us, the textbook was the authority.” In effect, Eksi Sozluk is not only an online dictionary but also a record of the Turkish people’s quest to define their own lives. It is also a chronicle of their frustrations and their humor. There are about 10 headlines on Eksi Sozluk concerning the 2017 Wikipedia ban: “29 April 2017 Wikipedia Access Ban,” “29 April 2017 Reason for Wikipedia Access Ban” and so on. Some entries on the subject include technical, historically accurate information. But many entries are simply jokes, small acts of defiance: In Turkey, there’s no need for information. Everyone knows a ton. And: How nice it is to feel this freedom everywhere. More often than not, the very censoring of articles serves as a weird confirmation of the truth of their content (even if they’re not true). The specificity behind removing a Wikipedia page like “2015 Turkey general election polls,” for example, suggests that the ruling A.K. Party didn’t want the Turks to know that it was doing poorly in the 2015 elections. Recently, when some websites and newspapers reported a rumor about the personal life of the president’s son-in-law and those sites promptly disappeared into the ether, a friend, after admitting to clicking on “so many” headlines, said: “If they went to all that trouble to remove it, then you think it must be true.” Taking down a website because of its lame gossip reminds Turks that at all times they could be punished for even the most minor infractions on Facebook or Twitter — or in any other realm of life. The government doesn’t necessarily succeed in preventing its people from learning or reading or watching things. But it succeeds in letting its citizens know that there are limits to their personal freedom. The people in Turkey who want to produce or consume truth end up doing so online or in their living rooms, among friends and family, huddling together and preserving their little spaces of sanity, a million bunkers of truth waiting for the abusive storm to pass. There are moments of collective reckoning with the truth, however. Earlier this year, just before a mayoral election in Istanbul, a financial crisis led to soaring food prices. Pro-government media channels for the most part played down the crisis. But Turks going to the bazaar or the grocery store found they could no longer afford fruits and vegetables. Low-budget videos appeared on social media showing something that Turks rarely saw in the mainstream press: the intensity of the anger at the government. These videos featured a single reporter with a mic standing somewhere in Istanbul — often in neighborhoods far from the more prosperous city center — asking people whom they planned to vote for. Many were elderly or mothers or fervent supporters of Erdogan. They yelled about the prices of tomatoes and onions, about the tax on plastic grocery-shopping bags. All of a sudden, it felt as if the mayoral candidate from Erdogan’s A.K. Party could actually lose the election — an unthinkable outcome in a city his party had ruled for 25 years. And in fact, the A.K. Party candidate lost. It came as a surprise to everyone, even if they’d seen the videos. Anyone could have heard those complaints all over town, it’s true. The street is perhaps one of Turkey’s last great bastions for both reliable gossip and facts. But the impact of seeing women on a screen complaining about onions was electrifying. The videos were a reminder of what a diverse media, a free internet, is supposed to do — bring the world to the people. In those moments, seeing real life on a screen again, Turks might have been reminded, after years of media censorship and the government’s relentless production of its desired reality, how little they knew about their fellow Turks anymore. That ignorance — and the appeal of its antidote — may be especially prevalent during wartime. In October, Turkey invaded Syria, and the war against information in Turkey reached a new pitch. The most repressive measures against the internet have always focused on the government’s enemies — primarily the P.K.K., or the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, and often anyone affiliated with the fight for Kurdish rights. In 2015, during the war in the southeast against the P.K.K., the government shut down all internet service in specific locations across the region. Turks heard only snippets of horrific stories from the front lines. Much of the despair activists expressed during that time had to do with the feeling that they might never know what happened in the southeast at all. As soon as Turkey invaded northern Syria in October, the government repeated some of these measures, including disrupting social media networks like Facebook and Twitter in spots along the Syrian border, like Hatay and Gaziantep. “We will not tolerate broadcasts that serve the purpose of terrorism,” the Turkish Supreme Council for Radio and Television announced, “that might mislead our citizens with false and biased information.” As the Turkish military moved into Syria, a new English-language website appeared in Turkey called Duvar English. The Turkish version of the site had been one of the last remaining relatively free and independent sources of information and opinion; the English-language site signaled greater ambitions. Many of its editors, columnists and journalists had either been fired by or pushed out of Turkish newspapers and universities. In its first days, a few of the columnists wrote about censorship and its effects. “War’s first casualty is truth,” the editor in chief Cansu Camlibel wrote in her inaugural column, quoting an American politician from the 1910s. Another columnist, Mehves Evin, tried to posit exactly what was being lost in this conflict. Since the invasion, she noted, some 186 Turks had been taken into custody for comments made online; 28 were imprisoned. The Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office of Istanbul and the General Directorate of Security issued a warning “that any news, analysis or social media comments ‘targeting the Turkish army and its operation, attempting to destroy public peace and unity,’ would be investigated under Turkey’s Penalty Code and Anti Terror Law.” Even more sinister, the Interior Ministry had announced that something called “cyber units” were patrolling “social media 7/24.” “Those voices urging peace and pointing out that military intervention will destabilize the country can only be heard in alternative digital media,” Evin wrote. If so, “one might wonder whether the vast majority of Turkish society really is opposed to the prospect of a peaceful solution.” Even if you believe most Turks backed the invasion, it’s hard to miss Evin’s point. After so many years of censorship, who is to say what anyone really feels or believes in Turkey anymore? By what method would anyone even gather and represent those feelings? During the Istanbul mayoral election, the country surprised itself, and its citizens surprised one another. During the war in Syria, it has made sense to ask how much of the country does not reflexively support Erdogan’s foreign war. There is no way to know. A heavily censored society not only loses access to information; it ceases to know itself. The greatest loss the Turks face under Erdogan might be their knowledge of one another. There is another loss, an international one. What was striking about the advent of Duvar English was how often more than one columnist described the challenge of transmitting news and information to the West. “Ten years ago, it was impossible to translate Turkey for the foreign audience,” the columnist Ece Temelkuran wrote. “It wasn’t because we the English-speaking Turks didn’t have the vocabulary; it was because what we went through politically simply did not make sense to the Western audience.” She also asked: “When some nations are written off as lost, is there really such a thing as a connected humanity left on the planet? And if my country is now treated as one of those crazy countries where anything can happen, is it still worth trying to write in this language of strangers?” Her sentiments are ones I hear with increasing regularity in Turkey, from those who feel the foreign news about Turkey is so obsessed with Erdogan as the all-powerful, evil authoritarian that they miss the country’s many complexities, of even the government and especially of the opposition. Foreigners, above all Westerners, are disposed to ascribe the tendencies of the ruler and the deteriorating state of a democracy to the people themselves. A country enduring authoritarian rule can be simply dismissed, written off as a place “lost” to humanity, as a “crazy country.” But it’s the country — the people — who have been the ones persevering, hoping for better, protecting their bunkers of truth and facts for the future. The columnists at Duvar English were reminding the West that even though their voices were being silenced, that did not mean the rest of the world should stop listening.

Jim Motavalli,"At a glance, this topless 1974 Ford Bronco looks every part the classic S.U.V. it is. But pop the hood and discover a supercharged 700-horsepower Coyote V-8 engine, whose low, throaty rumble helped draw a crowd to the Bronco’s parking spot outside the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. The time warp continues inside, where contemporary creature comforts await. An infotainment system? Check. Fancy carpeting and heated seats? A six-speed automatic shifter? Yes to all that, and to its complete lack of drama. Unlike some high-performance cars of the period, the Bronco doesn’t overheat or refuse to idle smoothly, and it handles and stops much better than any 1970s Ford product ever did. Climbing into a cab raised more than five inches was simple, thanks to running boards that slide out when the doors are opened. And 16 miles per gallon combined isn’t terrible, considering the power on tap. The Bronco is a so-called restomod, a fast-growing category of autos built not just for gearheads who like to get under the hood but for families that simply like the look of old cars . “Everyone loves the old look,” said Ken Lingenfelter, who acquired his first Corvette in 1977 and builds high-performance engines for them and other sporty models at his operations in Michigan. “And the cars where every nut and bolt is right, they’ve always done well at auctions and become the gold standard. “But when you drive your collector car,” he added, “you want it to be able to have reliable air conditioning, to be able to stop correctly and to run without smelling like gasoline all the time.” Gateway Bronco of Hamel, Ill., restored the 1974 vehicle with up-to-the-minute technology, and it is headed for a Barrett-Jackson charity auction in mid-January at a list price of $348,060 as equipped, but could sell for more. The customers in this market, some of them much younger than the average classic car owner , are willing to pay premium prices. Most restomods are based on American performance cars, like Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs and Chargers, but some European and Japanese vehicles are joining in the trend. “People like restomods because they’re so useful,” said Seth Burgett, president and chief executive of Gateway Bronco, as well as the owner of several Shelby Mustangs . “Anyone in the family can just get in and drive them.” Some owners commute in their cars, something rarely done with authentically restored classics, and others use them for Sunday drives or park them at the vacation home. In short, they get used. Of course, restoring old cars to anything other than their factory specifications is sacrilege to some, but market trends are proving that many of today’s buyers didn’t get that memo. “We are starting to see some categories where the restomods are actually selling higher than original, matching-numbers cars,” said Craig Jackson, chairman and chief executive of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company, via email. “Because people want to drive and enjoy them.” He said baby boomers were still the largest market for the more expensive restomods, but the number of Generation X and millennial buyers is growing. Lance Stander, the chief of Superformance/Shelby Legendary Cars, which makes cars like the Ford GT40 and the Shelby Cobra under license, agreed. “Our buyers used to be mostly 55- and 60-year-olds who liked these cars when they were in college,” said Mr. Stander, whose company is in Irvine, Calif. “Now we’re getting kids with dreadlocks and young tech guys. They’re a lot younger, many of them under 40.” Troy Trepanier, who runs Rad Rides by Troy in Manteno, Ill., said business was booming for his high-ticket, mostly American cars. His custom builds start at $500,000 and average $750,000. Even at those prices, the shop has orders stretching out five or six years. “Our typical customer is someone who has been hands-on with cars,” Mr. Trepanier said. “They know what it takes to put together a vehicle like this, and they have the means to pay for, sometimes, more than one.” The auction house Gooding and Company specializes in cars that are either highly original or “correctly,” restored, but David Gooding, the chief and founder, said, “I see why there is a demand.” Mr. Gooding pointed out that American cars adapted readily to the treatment, because they tend to have the space for added components, such as larger engines, bigger wheels and add-on air-conditioning systems. While Detroit may be well represented in this genre, it crosses borders. Singer Vehicle Design in Sun Valley, Calif., restores and “reimagines” old Porsches, putting air-cooled engines of up to 390 horsepower in cars that look like the classic 1960s 911 but have lightweight carbon-fiber bodywork and a more modern Porsche base. Steven Davis, vice president for sales and client relations at Singer, said the company had 130 cars “in the field” and many more on order. Drew Coblitz, a 31-year-old consultant in Philadelphia, recently took delivery of a dark blue Singer-restored car, his second. “I really wanted something incredibly special that would stand out among the many expensive cars out today,” he said. “I like having something so major that is still kind of undercover.” Among Mr. Coblitz’s other cars are a Lamborghini Urus S.U.V. and a McLaren 600LT. Sometimes, the manufacturer does the modernizing. Between 1996 and 2009, Mercedes-Benz’s in-house performance division, AMG, modified 11 classic 300SL models (eight “Gullwings” and three roadsters) with modern six-liter, 381-horsepower V-8 engines, air conditioning, Recaro sport seats and other features. They all had airbags installed, too, Mercedes said. Given that Gullwings in their original state are scarce and highly prized, the auto site Motorious called one such conversion “a crime against classic cars.” A danger with restomods is overdoing it. Owners who have been too enthusiastic about imposing their personal tastes on the projects may be at a disadvantage at resale time. “You have to decide if you’re going to build it for the mass market or just for yourself,” Mr. Jackson said. “It’s easy to go overboard on customization.” Celebrities have been prominent buyers in this market, and an accident involving the actor and comedian Kevin Hart points to the cars’ safety issues. He was badly injured in September as a passenger in his 1970 Plymouth Barracuda, powered by a 720-horsepower Hellcat engine. The California Highway Patrol said that “a harness could have prevented or minimized the injuries that Kevin and the driver suffered.” Safety, including roll cages and harnesses, should definitely be — and usually are — part of the upgrade package for these cars, though installation of airbags requires complex engineering and is best left to manufacturers. Still, as Jay Leno, the comic and car enthusiast, pointed out in a Popular Mechanics column, “No matter how much you upgrade an antique car, it is never going to be as safe as a modern vehicle.”","Nov. 14, 2019",New York Times,NA,"Vintage Cars With Old Souls, and Touch Screens and A.C.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/business/collector-cars-restomods.html
Natasha Singer,"In 1976, the Harvard School of Public Health and two other major medical institutions started a study on nurses that has become one of the largest and longest research efforts ever conducted on women’s health. They have  so far enrolled more than 275,000 participants . On Thursday, the Harvard school announced an even more ambitious women’s health study, one that aims to enroll a million women over a decade. The new ingredients allowing the huge scale: Apple’s iPhones, apps and money. Harvard’s new study is just one of three new large research efforts that Apple is working on with leading academic research centers an d health organization s. Together, the studies, which Apple is paying for, show how the Silicon Valley giant and its popular products are reshaping medical research. To enroll in clinical trials, patients have often had to travel to medical centers to be briefed by researchers and fill out the study paperwork in person. Many studies also follow patients only intermittently, in periodic surveys and visits to hospitals. But Apple tools are enabling large-scale virtual studies that can follow people as they go about their daily lives. The company has developed a research app for iPhones — which participants can download from its app store — that is helping researchers quickly and easily recruit hundreds of thousands of study volunteers. Researchers at Stanford Medicine, who studied whether an app on the Apple Watch could detect an irregular heartbeat condition, were able to enroll more than 400,000 participants in just eight months. Apple helped recruit volunteers by promoting  the study , which was published on Wednesday, in its app store and emailing customers who had bought Apple Watches. Dr. Ethan Weiss, an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said he thought there would be many more of these so-called virtual studies, partly because they reduce the burden and costs compared with in-person studies. He noted, however, that doctors did not yet know whether monitoring people en masse through smartphones and consumer-wearable devices would significantly improve health outcomes. “This is the big question. Is this ‘so what’? Or are we going to learn something meaningful we don’t know yet?” Michelle A. Williams, the dean of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said she hoped the new study of women, called the Apple Women’s Health Study, would enable researchers to learn much more about how women’s bodies and reproductive health change over time. Through surveys, she said, women participating in the study may choose to provide qualitative information about their menstrual cycles, pregnancies, menopause and other health issues. Through the study’s app, they may also choose to automatically share fitness, heart rate and other quantitative data gathered by their iPhones or Apple Watches. “ I’m most excited about the fact that we’ll be able to collect women’s menstrual cycle information in ways that we’ve not really done before,” Professor Williams said. “Having this data on a large modern cohort is so relevant to clinical women’s health today because a lot of the decision making and diagnostic protocols that we’re currently using are from data from 50 years ago, when the social environment was different.” Apple’s involvement in the research studies is the latest example of how the biggest tech companies are edging their way into the country’s $3. 5 trillion health care market. The companies are making inroads in medicine in part by exploiting their scale, along with the technologies that have helped them dominate markets like cloud computing, search, productivity tools and consumer apps. Microsoft recently began testing an artificial intelligence system for hospitals that records, transcribes and analyzes doctor-patient conversations. Google is working with hospitals to analyze millions of patients’ medical records in the hopes of identifying patterns to improve diagnosis and treatment. Apple is striking out in a different direction. The company has acquired health and wellness start-ups and hired prominent medical researchers. It has made health a marketing point of its devices. Last year, it introduced an electrocardiogram app on the Apple Watch Series 4. This year it introduced menstrual cycle tracking and hearing health services for the iPhone and the watch. In addition to the women’s health study, Apple is sponsoring a study, led by researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, that will examine physical activity and heart data from the Apple Watch to try to identify early warning signs of declining heart health. Another study, by researchers at the University of Michigan, will collect noise level data from headphones and an iPhone app to examine how long-term sound exposure can affect hearing. The names of the studies also provide a marketing opportunity: They’re called the Apple Hearing Study, the Apple Women’s Health Study, and the Apple Heart and Movement Study. Jeff Williams, the chief operating officer of Apple, said the company hoped the studies would bolster the understanding of women’s, heart and hearing health. Apple also hopes to use the study data to improve its products or create new ones. “We have a noise meter on people’s Apple Watches,” Mr. Williams said. “If we can help them understand the sound exposure in their environment and help them avoid the problem, or at least mitigate the problem, with hearing loss, that’s a huge contribution to society.” The Apple studies could also influence how research studies treat health privacy. Apple’s research app allows study participants to granularly choose which types of information — such as heart or physical activity data — they share with researchers. Participants also have the ability to stop sharing their data or change their data-sharing category selections at any time. They can also choose to delete the current day’s data before it is shared with the study. Apple has long marketed privacy as a feature that distinguishes its products from those of its rivals like Google. Apple has said that it does not have access to consumer data collected by the iPhone Health app, for instance, because the information is stored locally on users’ devices. For the research studies, Apple said the technology was designed to meet federal standards for safeguarding health information. The company also said its researchers would have access to study participants’ data under pseudonymous ID codes — not their names. But the studies reliant on Apple devices have inherent limitations, because owners of the company’s products are not representative of the general American population. People who use iPhones have a median income of about $89,000 compared with $64,510 for Android users, according to r ecent data from Comscore. Among the Apple Watch users in the Apple Heart Study, there was a lower percentage of women, African-Americans, Latinos and people ages 65 or older than in census data for the general population.   Professor Williams of Harvard said that the women’s health study would ask participants for demographic information and adapt its methodology to account for any underrepresented groups. There are also some concerns that Apple, which has already reshaped how people live, communicate and entertain themselves, is pursuing yet another way to influence society, this time through health. “The broader point here is the fact that Apple has control over the app store, that Apple has connections with all of the people that have Apple iPhones, and that Apple gets to make a lot of decisions about how you collect the data, about how to notify people to be a part of the study,” said Matt Stoller, the author of a new book, “ Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy .” Whatever the potential health benefits, he said, “it’s still an extraordinary concentration of power in Apple’s hands.”","Nov. 14, 2019",New York Times,NA,Apple’s Reach Reshapes Medical Research ,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/technology/apple-harvard-health-studies.html
Derrick Bryson Taylor,"Everything old is new again, sort of. Television shows from decades ago are getting the reboot treatment . Animated films from yesteryear are back in theaters with a digital makeover. And now the Razr, the unmistakable slim flip phone from the 2000s, has returned, hoping to ride the fad for foldable tech back into people’s pockets. Motorola announced the phone’s revival on Wednesday. Packed into its familiar retro clamshell design will be an Android operating system; two screens (a 6.2-inch touch-screen one on the inside and a 2.7-inch external one); and a lengthy list of other features that may or may not pull in millennials and lure away iPhone users. The price of this nostalgia is $1,499, slightly more than the most expensive version of Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max . Consumers can begin preordering the device on Dec. 26 through Verizon, according to a news release . The original Razr, released in 2004, came in nearly every color and was adored by millions for its sleek design. ( David Beckham even filmed a commercial for it .) In 2004, the aluminum device was the thinnest phone on the market, according to CNET . For many Razr users, angrily flipping the phone shut — no need to press “end” — was the best way to cut short an annoying call. A CNET reviewer summed up the device: “Streamlined. Utterly pocketable. Nostalgic, with a sharp futuristic edge.” The future of foldable phones was called into question this year after the release of Samsung’s Galaxy Fold . It generated a lot of attention, both for its design and its nearly $2,000 price, but it spiraled into a public-relations nightmare. Reviews slammed the screen’s quality and ultimately sank the phone’s reputation. Huawei is rolling out its Mate X foldable phone in China, but it has yet to hit the market in the United States. Sergio Buniac, the president of Motorola, told CNET that the company developed the new Razr after seeing a consumer need for foldable phones. “It’s not like we decided to relaunch the Razr and figured something out,” he said. Asked how the company would position the phone, given that it brings back memories for a certain generation but has no significance for today’s teenagers, Mr. Buniac said: “Foldable is a technology that’s starting. We believe there are so many options and avenues with that, so we have to think about new consumer segments as we move forward.” Mr. Buniac said he saw the Razr as a franchise. The phone was originally set to be released in the summer, but it was delayed until January. “We are two or three months behind,” Mr. Buniac said. “That’s O.K. It’s new technology. There are good days and bad days, but we want to feel that it’s really mature before going to market.” The company’s gambit seemed to be resonating with social media users on Thursday. One woman said on Twitter that her first thought about the phone’s release was “that’s hot,” a possible nod to Paris Hilton, a noted Razr user in the 2000s . “I loved my hot pink Razr man,” another woman said on Twitter. “Flipping that thing closed felt so powerful!” Others zeroed in on the price. “Loved the phone. Not the price,” one man on Twitter said of the new phone. Another man was more frank, calling the price “silly.” A review by Tech Radar said Motorola’s new Razr was a “bold experiment” for keeping an old look and added that the phone inherited the original version’s early reputation “as a pricey status symbol.” Digital Trends put it this way: “The Motorola Razr relies a lot on design and nostalgia to win over fans.”","Nov. 14, 2019",New York Times,NA,"The Razr’s Back, Flipping Open an Old Love Story",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/technology/motorola-razr-foldable-phone.html
Sheera Frenkel,"SAN FRANCISCO — A week ago, YouTube and Facebook said they would block people from identifying the government official thought to be the whistle-blower who set in motion an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. It hasn’t worked out so well. A name believed by some to be the whistle-blower has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. Videos discussing the identity of the whistle-blower have been watched by hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube. And images professing to be of the person have circulated on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, under dozens of different hashtags. The purported name of the whistle-blower appeared on Facebook pages that, combined, were followed by over half a million Facebook users, according to CrowdTangle, a tool that analyzes interactions across the site. It is unclear how many of those users saw the post, but the name was easily searchable within various Facebook pages, including right-wing news sites and an individual running for Congress. The failure to keep this official’s name off social media is the latest indication of how difficult it is for these companies to police their sprawling platforms. Armies of human content moderators and screening with artificial intelligence have often proved unfit for the task, particularly when many people are intent on breaking the rules. A mishmash of policies and lack of coordination among the companies have added to the challenge. Facebook and YouTube said they would block attempts to name the whistle-blower, but Twitter said naming him would not violate their policies, so long as posts did not also have more personal information, like an address or phone number. “The policies created by the social media companies look great in isolation. They look great on paper. But each time something like this happens, it shows the problems of each company acting in a silo,” said Claire Wardle, executive director of First Draft , an organization that fights online disinformation. “Companies don’t yet have a way to do this in a way that is effective, and something more than Whac-a-Mole.” YouTube and Facebook said they would remove any mentions of the whistle-blower’s name from their sites because naming the whistle-blower violated their so-called coordinated harm policies, which prohibit content intended to out a “witness, informant or activist.” The companies would not say how many posts they have taken down. But Facebook users, for example, have been creative in their efforts to sidestep the company’s content moderation. They have avoided using the name within the text of their posts, which could alert A.I. systems screening for it. Instead, they have included it in the URL or inside an image. Others intentionally added characters such as dollar-signs and asterisks to avoid Facebook’s automated moderation. Twitter, notably, didn’t block naming the whistle-blower. That allowed Donald Trump Jr., who has over four million followers, to tweet a name. Numerous conservative commentators spread Mr. Trump’s tweet, and began sharing images and videos on social media channels that they believed showed the person’s identity. YouTube had taken additional steps to make it difficult to search for the name, removing an autocomplete feature that filled in the name once a person began typing it. If, however, the whistle-blower’s full name was already known, users could easily find it. On Tuesday morning, the top three videos claiming to share the whistle-blower’s name each had over 100,000 views. The videos often avoided using the name in the title over the video. Instead, they shared it in the comments and discussions below the video, where people also linked to blogs discussing the identity. Many videos with the name were taken down after The New York Times asked YouTube about them. Facebook was unwilling to comment on whether it was seeing a coordinated effort to spread the whistle-blower’s name, but said it would continue to take down content that violated its policies. YouTube did not respond to a request for comment on the videos being shared on its site. On Instagram, photographs purporting to show the whistle-blower with a number of public figures from the Democratic Party were also widely shared. Earlier in the week, Instagram had blocked searches for the last name being circulated, or for the hashtag #whistle-blower. But on Thursday, it was possible to search on that hashtag, as well as the purported full name or variations of the name. Instagram said it temporarily blocked searches for #whistle-blower while it calibrated its systems to ensure that legitimate searches for the term, or the purported name, were not being affected. A Twitter spokeswoman said posting names and images did not violate Twitter rules. She said Twitter bans only specific types of private information, such as sharing a person’s home address, private phone number or government identification without their consent. President Trump, and his supporters, have called for the name of the whistle-blower to be made public. On Wednesday, during the House’s first public hearing in its impeachment inquiry , Republican members of Congress repeated calls for the whistle-blower to be identified. The New York Times and most other major news organizations have not named the whistle-blower, though The Times and others reported he was a C.I.A. analyst . Experts who study the way information moves across social media said that in a number of cases the blogs, photographs and videos were first gaining popularity on Twitter and Reddit, which has also allowed discussions about the whistle-blower’s identity. Users of Twitter and Reddit were also using those sites to coordinate how to spread the whistle-blower’s name on other platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. On one Reddit channel, dedicated to supporting President Trump, thousands of people voted on and shared methods by which they had successfully posted the purported whistle-blower’s name onto Facebook and YouTube. “The information ecosystem is interconnected and related,” Ms. Wardle said. “The minute a piece of information is out anywhere, it is game over; that piece of information can spread anywhere.” Conspiracy theorists and people with fringe beliefs have become adept at using social media to get ahead of news cycles, and sow misinformation before mainstream news organizations can establish verified facts. And they have become skilled at avoiding community standards on social media sites. In the weeks after the March 15 attack on a New Zealand mosque , for example, violent videos of the attack flooded Facebook, YouTube and other social media channels. Facebook said on Wednesday that it had taken down 4.5 million pieces of content related to that episode between March 15 and Sept. 30. “Here we are, in the midst of impeachment hearings, and we are witnessing the real time seeding of a story line by conspiracy theorists through social media,” said Joan Donovan, a research director at Harvard University’s Shorenstein Center. Sharing the potential identity of the whistle-blower also helps bring together people with like-minded views, said Ms. Donovan. Communities formed online to spread certain types of content tend to work together again and again, creating organized campaigns aimed at overwhelming social media companies. Companies don’t have the technology yet to take down every piece of banned content as it is uploaded, Ms. Wardle said. And when people are able to organize and coordinate on one social media platform to spread information on another, it is nearly impossible to track, she said. “People are testing the platforms ahead of 2020. This is a perfect moment to see what works, and what doesn’t,” she said. “So far, we know what doesn’t.” Ben Decker contributed reporting from New York.","Nov. 14, 2019",New York Times,NA,Whistle-Blower’s Purported Name Keeps Evading Facebook and YouTube Defenses,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/technology/whistleblower-name-facebook-youtube.html
Kate Conger,"Amazon on Thursday said it planned to officially challenge the Pentagon’s surprise decision last month to award a $10 billion cloud-computing contract to Microsoft, setting off another legal battle over the lucrative, decade-long project. Amazon said it had notified a federal court of its plans to protest the government’s decision. In a statement, a spokesman for the company suggested that the contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, known as JEDI, was awarded based on political motivations. “It’s critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence,” said Drew Herdener, the Amazon spokesman, in the statement. “Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias — and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified,” he said. Amazon had been considered the front-runner for the contract, partly because it had built cloud services for the Central Intelligence Agency. It is also the country’s biggest cloud computing provider. But President Trump said publicly that other “great companies” should have a chance at the contract. Mr. Trump has openly criticized Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, who also owns The Washington Post. The president has accused the paper of spreading “fake news.” A speechwriter for Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary, says in a book published recently that Mr. Trump had wanted to give the contract to another company. It would be improper for a president to intervene in the awarding of a contract, according to experts on federal contracting. The Defense Department said it would not speculate on potential litigation. A spokesman for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The JEDI contract is significant for the military and for technology companies that are increasingly seeking government business. The military frequently operates on outdated computer systems, and the Defense Department has spent billions of dollars on modernization efforts. Microsoft’s victory in the contracting process has the potential to reshape the cloud computing industry, in which Amazon is the dominant player. It could also establish Microsoft as the first choice for government agencies, putting it in prime position to win the roughly $40 billion that the federal government is expected to spend on cloud services over the next few years, analysts said. Daniel Ives, the managing director of Wedbush Securities, said Amazon’s protest “was to be expected, given how significant the JEDI deal is.” While new information about Mr. Trump’s actions could emerge, he said, he believes the protest was unlikely to change the result of the bid award, because “this is the most scrutinized contract D.O.D. has ever had.” Mr. Ives said Amazon’s protest would prompt an internal Pentagon review that he expects to take 45 to 60 days and will delay the beginning of work by Microsoft. The decision is likely to be taken to court by the loser, but work should begin on the cloud contract as the court battle plays out.

Taylor Lorenz,"This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series , which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve. LOS ANGELES — FaZe Clan could be called a media company, or an esports team, or an influencer marketing agency, or all of the above. “Something like who we are has never existed before,” said Lee Trink, the organization’s chief executive. He comes from the entertainment world (he helped discover Kid Rock) and his best attempt is to describe FaZe Clan is the Dallas Cowboys meets Supreme meets MTV. But it’s more than that: a direct-to-consumer e-commerce business, releasing merchandise and apparel; an in-house content production studio; a talent-management business; a sales team acting as a mini advertising agency negotiating brand deals; and a technology arm that develops software to meet the demands of talent. Teenagers find this corporate conglomerate incredibly cool. FaZe Clan fans get FaZe tattoos , doodle FaZe logos on their notebooks at school and show up outside the group’s Hollywood Hills house begging for pictures. When a group of members visited SoHo in New York City this summer, multiple city blocks were closed after thousands of fans flooded the streets . This weekend, they’ll open their first storefront , on Melrose Ave. in Los Angeles, and it threatens to be a “legendary moment,” as a FaZe member put it. FaZe Clan consists of 34 content creators and 15 professional esports players, and 11 hybrid creators who are both pro players and entertainers . All of them excel at creating social media clips; together they have brought 214 million viewers into the fold. Members are easy to recognize online. They refer to themselves using their gamer tags, which always start with “FaZe.” There’s FaZe Banks, 27; FaZe Temperrr, 24; FaZe Rain, 23; and FaZe Apex, 23, four early members considered the backbone of the organization. FaZe Kay, a 23-year-old British Twitch star and gamer with 3.2 million subscribers on YouTube, joined in 2014. His younger brother, FaZe Jarvis, is the resident baby brother of the FaZe house and often the butt of pranks. (He once won a Fortnite game with a boa constrictor coiled around his neck .) Jarvis also might be the first great casualty of the organization. He recently received a lifetime ban from Fortnite . That game has been his ticket to top tier employment and his source of fame. He is now deciding what’s next . “I’ve just been taking a lot of time to reflect on everything,” he told his subscribers a few days ago. He is 17. FaZe Clan moved to Los Angeles in 2016, first to Newport, then to Calabasas and, in 2018, into dual 12,500-square-foot mansions in the Hollywood Hills. One house is full of strictly FaZe members. The other contains a roving cast of FaZe- adjacent influencers, like RiceGum (a model and rapper) and Sommer Ray (a fitness model). The houses act as live-in dorms for influencers. During the day, they work. One day in October, Vera Salamone , FaZe Clan’s director of talent, conducted a 10 a.m. stand-up meeting. She asked the boys  what they planned to accomplish during the day. “I have meetings, then I’m making a video with Jarvis. Getting ready for the weekend. I just want a day off,” said FaZe Kay. Everyone laughed. After the meeting, the gamers slumped off into their rooms to begin the daily grind. Most FaZe Clan members spend the majority of their time in their bedrooms, posted up in front of their gaming stations. “I spent 90 percent of my time here in my room,” said FaZe Kay. “There’s not much you can really do,” he continued. “All I do is play Fortnite anyway. I sit in my set up and play, so I’m not really too bothered. I don’t even really go outside too much.” Many members played varsity sports in high school. They are obsessed with fitness and nutrition. The third-floor common area of the current FaZe house is dedicated to a gym. “We aren’t shy, antisocial quote unquote weird kids that are out of shape, don’t play sports, don’t mess with girls and don’t eat well,” said Banks. “We do all that stuff.” FaZe Clan members make things for their channels, the collective FaZe channels, or for brands. This year FaZe has done advertising deals with Fortune 500 brands including Nissan and Burger King . (For Burger King, some of them ate burgers blindfolded for a video and appeared surprised to find out that they were not made of meat. “That’s lit,” said FaZe Cizzorz .) The FaZe Clan house proper is sprawling, with white marble floors and metallic silver railings. It is also empty, devoid of personal belongings. A neon FaZe logo hangs by the TV above the fireplace. There’s a pool table that remains untouched. TV screens around the house display live counts and rankings of members’ YouTube, Twitch and Instagram followings. Gamers flop around on oversized bean bag chairs that litter the top floor, the default common area . The unofficial uniform is FaZe Clan merch paired with designer sportswear and brand-name slides . “These are Louis Vuitton sliders,” FaZe Jarvis said when asked about his footwear. “I have three pairs of sliders: Off-White, Louis and Givenchy ones.” His older brother was decked out in  Gucci. They aren’t particularly into fashion, the brothers said. They just buy nice things because they can. FaZe Clan members block out the neighborhood’s breathtaking views with thick blinds to prevent glare. The rooms feel like packed caves. Beds are generally unmade and in various states of disarray. FaZe Temperrr has the largest room in the house. Larger than a small New York City apartment, it’s crammed with piles of personal items: a box of Travis Scott limited-edition Reese’s Puffs, a Gucci wallet, a plush Mario doll. His mantle is covered with anime figurines and childhood photos. FaZe Barry , Temperrr’s Bengal cat, roams his huge marble bathroom. FaZe Kay keeps a Boring company fire extinguisher on his bedside table, propped up against his gold YouTube play button plaque, awarded when he reached 1 million followers. Empty Arrowhead water bottles are clustered around the plaque like prayer candles. FaZe Jarvis’s room is the one notable exception. It’s spotless and completely empty aside from a Dyson fan, his own YouTube play button plaque, also on his bedside table. Outside FaZe Jarvis’s room is the entrance to the house’s private movie theater, compete with a bar and a stripper pole on an elevated platform. Several members said one big misconception of life in the house is how monotonous some days can be. “People think it’s a lot crazier than it is because people see nothing but highlights,” said FaZe Teeqo . FaZe Clan members have a specific type of fame, an experience similar to teen stars and YouTubers. To anyone under the age of 20, they’re almost immediately recognizable. To adults they look like average kids. Most can get around L.A. without much hassle. “If you go to a mall on a Saturday, it’s not going to be too good,” said FaZe Teeqo. “But if I got to Trader Joe’s 10 a.m. on a Tuesday, it’s fine.” FaZe Clan made a name for itself by embracing influencer culture and taking a social media content-first approach to gaming . Back in 2010, Call of Duty (COD), a first-person shooter game, was wildly popular. While many top COD players focused on winning tournaments and accolades, FaZe Banks, FaZe Temperrr and other early FaZe members became famous for trickshotting. That’s when a player invents creative stunts in a game, sometimes to the detriment of their performance. It’s jumping off a building while spinning around 360 degrees and shooting someone on your way down. Sure, you died, but it looked cool. FaZe players would put these outrageous highlights on YouTube and promptly go viral. FaZe Banks, a former lacrosse player who began playing COD in 2009, mastered YouTube early. His first video, a tutorial on how to hack your Xbox score, generated $800 in ad revenue. “It was my moment where I was like, wait a second, there’s a lot of money to be made on the internet,” Banks said, “and my internet hustle was video games.” Just a handful of YouTubers had reached a million followers by then. “We were the first gamers really showing our faces on the internet,” said FaZe Temperrr. They inserted small reaction shots and narration over gameplay. Members also began vlogging, showcasing their daily nongaming lives. “People loved it,” Banks said. “People had something to follow outside the gameplay. They play COD every day, but now they get to see the lifestyle we live and that we’re cool kids.” In 2012, they began a traditional esports team, pairing panache and trickshotting and social media prowess with top gameplay talent. They quickly began racking up trophies. For most of FaZe Clan’s existence it had no corporate structure. “As soon as I met these guys, I was like, this is an incredible business, but there’s no infrastructure,” said Greg Selkoe , the organization’s president. The members of FaZe had fostered a fandom of millions online, but they weren’t effectively converting their audience numbers into cash. Last year, Mr. Selkoe and Mr. Trink signed on full time.  Now, about 70 people work for FaZe Clan on the business side. It took on a round of outside investment a year ago, and has welcomed celebrity members like Lil Yachty and Offset , who also invested. In September, the company announced a partnership with Manchester City , an elite soccer team. Their job is to create content around the sports franchise and to partner on merchandise. Just as Supreme was birthed from skateboarding culture, FaZe Clan hopes to establish a gaming-adjacent apparel business. It recently collaborated with Champion, New Era and 24karats, a high-fashion Japanese clothing line. Expansion efforts haven’t been without speed bumps. “If there’s multiple ways to do something, FaZe will do the craziest way,” said Mr. Trink. L ast year, a now-defunct social media company and former officemate sued the company for an undisclosed amount in excess of $1 million for “intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and misappropriation of trade secrets.” In May, Turner Tenney , one of the top Fortnite players in the world, sued FaZe Clan in a contract dispute . Mr. Tenney, known online as Tfue, said that FaZe had signed him into a predatory agreement in which the company could take up to 80 percent of his earnings in certain cases, and was violating California law by illegally operating as a talent agency. FaZe counter sued . Their litigation continues . “We’ve spent most of the past year getting our stuff together,” Mr. Trink said. “FaZe Clan was built by kids, the youngest being 14 at the time,” he added. “They didn’t think about potential lawsuits.” Among the cleanup: retroactively filing trademarks and revamping the way contracts are structured. They are also focused on recruiting its next generation of talent. This year, FaZe Clan welcomed FaZe H1ghSky1 , a 12-year-old gamer from Seattle, and FaZe Ew0k , a 13-year-old deaf Fortnite competitor and the first female member. FaZe Clan’s membership has remained predominantly male. Banks says he is desperate to change the perception that gaming is primarily for teen boys. “Everyone is a gamer. You play games on your phone? You’re a gamer,” he said. “My mom who plays Farmville is gamer. Sports is a gaming mentality. If you’ve ever played a sport, you’re a gamer.” The company, also, has an opportunity to offer more women’s apparel. T raditional esports teams, like OpTic , have taken a page out of FaZe’s playbook. They too are attempting to make more content and more personalities, not just win games. 100 Thieves , another company seeking to merge gaming and lifestyle, raised $35 million this summer. FaZe Clan’s relative scale, however, is staggering. FaZe Clan has more than 7.5 million followers on Instagram alone; 100 Thieves has 571,000. “As an organization they’ve got this incredible network effect,” said Sundance DiGiovanni , a co-founder of Major League Gaming. “When they bring someone in, that person sees an explosion on their social channels.” Like any average college-aged kid, FaZe Clan members like to have a good time. Some hit the clubs on the weekends or attend parties hosted by young Hollywood talent and fellow YouTube stars. Events at the FaZe Clan house itself have become infamous. Last year, the crew hosted a 900-person party with 700 young women. “Marshmello” — he’s a big D.J. — “said it was the best party he’s ever been to,” Temperrr said. In October, Banks and some friends caused an estimated $30,000 worth of damage to a hotel room at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas after a wild night. The less fun side is that burnout is a major concern for online creators . Nearly all top FaZe Clan members have experienced it. “It’s really hard to stay consistent with this level of work,” said FaZe Adapt. “There was a couple moments when it got hard. If I wasn’t posting every day, I was filming all day, editing all night.” In late October, FaZe Rain, one of the founding owner-members, posted a series of alarming messages on Twitter , and slammed fellow members of FaZe Clan for not being there for him. FaZe Rain had previously discussed struggling with depression, and revealed that he had suffered a “mental breakdown” that landed him in a psychiatric ward. “I’ve been doing this since I was 11 years old, man,” he said at the time, meaning making content for YouTube. Currently his social media output veers between “I feel like I lost myself” and, this week, “All you need is confidence then you can do anything.” FaZe Adapt and others have taken months offline to recuperate, but many members still regularly push themselves to the limit. “We work nonstop,” said FaZe Temperrr. “We’re well aware of what can happen if you don’t work hard. We’re at such a great point that if we we’re going to start slowing down , people would catch up and we wouldn’t have this opportunity again.” “If you don’t have your eyes on this, internet culture in general, esports, video games, if you still don’t take it seriously, you should. You need to wake up. Everyday we live more and more on the internet. If you can’t see where this is going you should pay more attention,” said Banks. “Eventually we will all live in the internet, and I want to exist in that world. That’s where I see us.”","Nov. 15, 2019",New York Times,NA,Can FaZe Clan Build a Billion-Dollar Business?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/style/faze-clan-house.html
Jamie Condliffe,"Each week, we review the week’s news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Hi, I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news: I’m about to suggest something that sounds controversial: Maybe it’s good that we keep discovering biased algorithms? Let’s rewind. A pair of articles this past week revealed that software that is used to make decisions on the behalf of humans appears to do so with gender bias. First, it came to light that the algorithm that calculates credit quotas for Apple’s new credit card may give higher limits to men than to women. Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, said its credit decisions were “based on a customer’s creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.” And my colleague Cade Metz reported that artificial intelligence services from Google and Amazon both failed to recognize the word “hers” as a pronoun, but correctly identified “his.” Other, similar algorithms “generally don’t give women enough credit” when analyzing text, he added. This isn’t surprising. Algorithms are written by humans, who are inherently biased — and that can seep into the way they frame the analysis that underlies their code. Artificial intelligence software is trained on data that contains all kinds of human biases, which can then appear in its own inferences. “What algorithms are doing is giving you a look in the mirror,” Sandra Wachter, an associate professor in law and A.I. ethics at Oxford University, told me. “They reflect the inequalities of our society.” That we often see inequality is troubling. If software is going to choose a credit limit, it should do so fairly. If A.I. is supposed to parse information for us, we would like it to do so objectively. The problem is, algorithms are everywhere, making decisions on our behalf in ways that are often opaque to us. “How many times am I not seeing certain jobs ads? How many times do I get advertised higher prices?” Professor Wachter asked. “I often don’t know that I’m being treated unfairly.” In that sense, the more often we unearth cases of bias, the better. Because not only is it one algorithm fewer left unchecked, it’s more evidence to demonstrate why we must solve the problem. Not that that’s easy, of course. Computer scientists are trying to work out how to spot and remove bias in data; others are developing ways to make algorithms better able to explain their decisions. And there are pushes to force companies to be more transparent and accountable about how they use algorithms. It’s a slog, but it is happening. “It’s unrealistic to assume that we’ll ever have a neutral system,” Professor Wachter said. “But with the right systems in place, we can mitigate some of the biases.” With that Apple Card article fresh in your mind, now is a good moment to think about Big Tech’s push into personal finance. Google announced that it was teaming up with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union to offer a “ smart checking ” account next year. Exactly what that will entail is unclear, but Google says it will help bank customers “benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,” via its Pay app. Also, Facebook unveiled a digital payment system , called Pay, that will let users make payments across its Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. That’s alongside its separate initiative to revolutionize the world of global finance with its own cryptocurrency, Libra. This is all unsurprising. The companies are attracted to the prospect of a new revenue stream. The question is whether or not they can make a go of it. Regulators and lawmakers are already unimpressed. New York State regulators said they would investigate the potentially discriminatory algorithm used by Apple Card. Libra has come under immense criticism from all sides because people don’t trust it . And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, already said of Google’s banking effort to CNBC: “ There ought to be very strict scrutiny .” But there’s another question here: Do people even want to use Big Tech to bank? There’s a lot of inertia in the world of personal finance, and persuading people to switch from their bank to Apple or Google or Facebook will require features with genuine utility, or higher interest rates, or something else stellar. Fear about financial data privacy is probably a concern for consumers, too. In other words, it’s a high bar. News surfaced that a partnership between Google and the hospital provider Ascension could allow the data of the health care company’s patients — 50 million in total — to be uploaded to Google’s cloud-computing platform . Without patients or doctors being notified, some of that data, including names, dates of birth, lab tests and diagnoses, were already being uploaded. Ascension said it was exploring “ machine-learning applications that will have the potential to support improvements in clinical quality” through the deal. Google said it would provide “ tools that Ascension could use to support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety.” This may all be totally O.K. It’s perfectly legal for health care providers to share patients’ medical information with business partners like electronic medical record companies. Still, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services plans to seek more information about whether it complies with the law anyway. Nonetheless, many people found it unnerving. That’s probably because of Google’s motivations: According to The Wall Street Journal , Google hasn’t charged Ascension for the work because it hopes to develop systems based on what it learns. It would eventually sell those systems to other health care providers. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that. But it comes off as a little tone deaf to slurp up data as intimate as health care records without informing patients, at a time when data privacy concerns are more heightened than ever. Apple plans to sell an augmented-reality headset by 2022 and augmented-reality glasses in 2023, according to a report by The Information . Microsoft will honor California’s new privacy law across the United States. It means all of its American users should enjoy the rules, meant to protect consumer data, after Jan. 1. Juul plans to cut $1 billion in costs next year , including the elimination of 650 jobs, as the e-cigarette maker struggles against regulatory and public concern about the risks of vaping. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, drew backlash by calling the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a “mistake” by the Saudi government. He quickly backtracked. Tesla plans to build its first European car factory near Berlin . It will also set up an engineering and design center in the area. Intel fixed a security flaw that it first said had been repaired six months ago, and still hasn’t totally fixed the issue in its chips. Security researchers say the company is misleading users . Disney introduced its Disney Plus streaming services. There were some initial bugs , but the service already has 10 million users. The internet didn’t turn out the way we had hoped.
