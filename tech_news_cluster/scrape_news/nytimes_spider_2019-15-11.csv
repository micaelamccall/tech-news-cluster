Amie Tsang,"Apple said on Friday that it would ban vaping apps from its online store, affecting 181 apps in total. The prohibition would affect apps that help people find vape stores or flavors, allow them to control their vape pens, or access games, news or social networks that promote vaping. “We take great care to curate the App Store as a trusted place for customers, particularly youth, to download apps,” Apple said in a statement. Apple said health authorities “have attributed a variety of lung injuries and fatalities to e-cigarette and vaping products, going so far as to call the spread of these devices a public health crisis and a youth epidemic.” “We agree, and we’ve updated our App Store Review Guidelines to reflect that apps encouraging or facilitating the use of these products are not permitted,” the company added. Cases of vaping-related illnesses have been rising, with more than 40 deaths and more than 2,000 illnesses, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C.D.C. has urged people to avoid vaping anything because the cause of illnesses still remains unclear. Apple, which had already stopped in June accepting new apps that promote vaping, will now ban new downloads altogether. Apple users who have already downloaded the apps will be able to continue using them and transfer them onto new devices. Apple’s decision was supported by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. “By taking e-cigarette related apps off the App Store, Apple will help reduce youth exposure to e-cigarette marketing and discourage youth use of these products, said Matthew L. Myers, the president of the campaign.

Elizabeth Weil,"On April 26, 2018, a 15-year-old named Antonio Garza sat in front of her mirror in her bedroom in Austin, Tex., turned on her phone and started talking to herself as she did her makeup. She had long, curly brown hair that she wished were straight, almost no nails at all and a red, irritated upper lip — she didn’t really know why her lip was red, it just was — and she displayed all this for the camera. “I’m dying — finally!” Antonio said, and for the next 20 minutes she oscillated like the teenager that she is, a kind of excited electron, bouncing between one shell of identity and the next: pimply high school freshman, femme glam diva, vulnerable diarist, camera-ready ham. Throughout, she flicked across her face dozens of makeup brushes and powders, creating cut-creases on her eyelids and contours on her cheekbones and nose, then applying fake eyelashes fluffy as kittens. As she did all this, she monologued about how she thought she was going to do a makeup channel but decided she didn’t want to do a makeup channel. “I need to not be annoying, and I’m not doing a good job at that,” Antonio said, cheerfully. “I also look ugly, and I’m really depressed!” Forty-five minutes later, tender, glittering and shellacked in cosmetics, she was ready for school. This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. A year earlier, in eighth grade, Antonio spent most of her time playing oboe and Fortnite, hanging out alone in her room and making mistakes with her eyebrows. This sounds as if it would be lame, and it was, in fact, lame. But being a depressed kid alone in your room is not what it used to be. It’s one thing to be depressed and listen to the Smiths in your oversize Champion sweatshirt and write in your journal and then hide that journal away and come out and pretend you have your act together. It’s another thing to be a depressed kid alone in your room in your oversize Champion sweatshirt and then make some videos that toggle back and forth, back and forth, between “I’m not thriving at all right now” and “Actually I just slayed”; between using Final Cut Pro to distort your face into the shape of a waterlogged Mr. Potato Head and creating a military-grade defense shield of foundation and bronzer. That is to say, to be a gender-bending kid alone in your room making videos that capture exactly what it feels like to be a teenager right now, the whole multipolar mess of humanity deep inside your own brain, and then post those videos to YouTube even though what you’ve just expressed to your smartphone you probably would not say to your mother in the kitchen and definitely would not say to your classmates, all of whom (you believe, wrongly) think you’re really weird. Later that afternoon, her hair now up in a ponytail, Antonio returned to her room and apologized to her 30 YouTube subscribers for being such a failure because she’d forgotten to vlog at school. Or really, she said, she hadn’t forgotten to vlog at school. She just hadn’t wanted to vlog at school because in every situation in her seven-hour school day, she felt uncomfortable. Also, she said, staring at the floor, she looked terrible. Which maybe you couldn’t tell in this lighting. But if you could tell and you were thinking of writing “You’re ugly” in the comments below — Antonio paused and stared into the camera, open as a wound. “Don’t,” she said. “Please.” She titled the video “Ninth Grade Makeup Transformation” and uploaded it to YouTube. Then nothing happened. Or at least nothing happened for a few days. Then right before finals week of her freshman year, Antonio’s phone start blowing up with notifications. On Sunday, May 13, 2018, Antonio reached 10,000 YouTube subscribers. By May 22, she had more than 100,000, and by May 31, 300,000. Kids started sending her screenshots of her face on their YouTube recommendation pages, saying: What the heck! I had no idea! Congrats! By then, thank God, school was out for summer vacation. Antonio hung out in her room making even more videos — digitally widening her brow and narrowing her chin until she looked like the alien E.T.; installing over her dark irises a pair of light blue contacts; slowing down her voice to lower it three octaves; taking mortifying trips to Target, where everybody stared at her; sharing how to get un-ugly tutorials that “include so many steps you might want to die”; saying: “I’m funny, I’m not funny at all. So that’s funny. It’s actually I’m funny though. …” By the time school reopened for Antonio’s sophomore year, she had a million YouTube subscribers, and it was basically impossible for her to attend. Because you can’t be a YouTuber and go to a big public school. You just can’t. Emma Chamberlain, who is 18 and who some say created the jumpy editing style Antonio now does better, dropped out. The Dolan twins, who are now 19 and who after five years of filming every aspect of their lives, including wisdom-teeth extractions, just announced that they were going to stop uploading weekly for the sake of their mental health, dropped out before her. As Antonio explained to me, to high schoolers YouTubers are the equivalent of mainstream celebrities. Each morning when she walked on campus, the same kids who ignored her for years suddenly wanted to take selfies with her in the courtyard. And the same kids she’d known forever, kids who had been in her gym class or played with her in middle-school band, were like, Do you remember me? You probably don’t remember me. And Antonio was like, Um, I’ve known you since we were 6. One day this past spring, I entered my home office to find that my 14-year-old had written ANTONIO GARZA on my whiteboard in small red letters. I texted her at school to ask why. “I thought it would be funny for u to watch one of her videos,” she wrote back. “Cuz ur old.” (She added, “jk, I love you.” Nice.) My daughter’s entertainment philosophy — not incorrect — was, and still is, that TV is primarily made by old people for old people and thus is irrelevant to her. YouTube, on the other hand, at least the part of it she sees, is made by teenagers for teenagers. And not just that, it’s made by teenagers talking to themselves in private, broadcasting their boredom-laced secret diaries, promising (and at moments, delivering) remote intimacy. This made watching those videos low-key compelling, good background for texting your friends or doing homework (if you were not inclined just to cue up a four-hour video of a person studying, which is now a thing). My daughter also found Antonio “relatable,” a huge buzzword among teenage YouTubers these days. “Is this what your brain feels like?” I asked. She said yes. Then she added, more knowingly than I might have liked: “You don’t think in one constant line of thought.” She meant both me specifically and humans in general. “My brain could never.” Meme accounts have taken over Instagram. According to Instagram, meme content is shared seven times more than nonmeme content on the service. The pages have grown so widespread that Instagram is hiring a meme-account liaison to work with such accounts. In 2016, Samir Mezrahi founded @KaleSalad , a tremendously popular meme account with more than 3.4 million followers. If you’re looking to start an account of your own, he has a few tips. 1. No interest is too niche. “You’ll be more successful if you make memes that are related to your interests. That could be your high school, your high school teams, cars, travel, you can focus on a movie, or show, or character — like Shrek.” 2. Straightforward handles are best. “You can have your interest and add ‘memes’ at the end of the handle; try to keep it as clear as possible. A lot of accounts have the words ‘zar,’ ‘plug,’ ‘memes’: You can add variations if your original name isn’t available. Kale Salad was a meme in itself back when I got it. Now it’s an old meme and kind of a dead meme, but it still works.” 3. Fake tweets and viral images are eternal. “A good genre of meme is when you tap into whatever the viral image of the moment is and make it your thing. One genre of meme uses the tweet format. That’s caption on the top and one or two images below; sometimes there’s text on the images. People digest that format well.” 4. Be shameless. “After you post your first meme, you have to promote it. Every time you post, you should share it to your Instagram Stories. You need to tell people to follow you and check out your account. You can use some hashtags to start. Try to get anyone in your existing network to check out your account. And be consistent. A lot of people don’t post enough; you can post a few times a day.” 5. Go private. “Going private is a fun growth hack. You set your account to private because D.M.s are a popular thing on Instagram. Friends D.M. each other memes, and when your account is set to private, the person you send it to can’t see them, so it forces them to follow you to see the meme.'' Later in the summer, this same child introduced me to JoJo Siwa , another 16-year-old denizen of the internet. JoJo achieved some fame as a star on the reality-TV show “Dance Moms” but became a megastar online, just as herself. Or really an avatar of herself. Her persona is deliriously, dementedly plastic and flat, a 6-year-old beauty-pageant princess rolled out in a pasta machine. While Antonio circumscribes vast swaths of the human experience pinballing around her six-dimensional universe — guileless/sophisticated; earnest/glib; confident/troubled; boyish/girlish; accomplished/bumbling; thriving/morose — JoJo seems to emerge from a deep youth internet mind-set that we’re all Bitmoji-ed, filtered and served up on tiny screens anyway, so why even bother pretending you’re warmblooded and whole? The result is horrifying to just about everybody who is not a child or a teenager, including Justin Bieber (who in the not-so-distant past committed his own teenage culture crimes). Last December, JoJo posted on Instagram an image of herself with a new car: a white BMW with a custom paint job that featured rainbows, sparkles, hearts and a gigantic airbrushed photo of her face. Bieber commented, “Burn it.” (Later, he apologized, and JoJo asked him to play at her 16th-birthday party; he didn’t.) My 17-year-old daughter, in contrast, watched Jeffree Star , a sort of adult male goth drag version of JoJo who joined YouTube in 2006 and currently sells $100 million worth of his cosmetics annually, and whose own identity is such a deliberately plastic work of self-creation that he has had injections, surgery and other procedures on his lips, forehead, nose, teeth and hair. She even watched videos of a fellow YouTube megacelebrity, Shane Dawson, interviewing Jeffree Star while made up and dressed up as Jeffree Star, the two of them in platinum blond wigs and matching $1,850 Gucci tracksuits. I found this vertigo-inducing unless I viewed it as campy, Escher-inspired video art. But to my daughter it was a relief: Dawson and Star offered their fans the knowledge that you could put on just about any persona you wanted with little or no risk, as with a costume change and some cosmetics-removing wipes, you could simply make that persona go away. You could test out look after look after look, possibility after possibility. One minute your inner diva; the next, your inner nerd. You could treat the whole exercise as ironic. Or experiment with radical sincerity, knowing you could retreat into the safe waters of cynicism if the embarrassment grew too hot. My daughter found this comforting, even counterintuitively stabilizing. “Every morning I go in the bathroom at school, and everybody is putting on makeup, and everybody is changing out of the clothes they wore for their mom,” she told me. “Like literally every morning. And everyone is saying, ‘This is the ugliest I’ve ever been,’ or, ‘I look like I’m in a punk-rock band,’ or, ‘I look like I’m an e-boy.’ It’s just like cognitive dissonance.” It is also just like the human experience. Especially at age 16. Antonio always knew a few things about herself. She knew she wanted to have long, straight hair, and she knew she wanted to wear so much makeup and just be like, essentially, perfect. She didn’t want to look like her mom — she loves her mom, and her mom is beautiful, but no, absolutely not, she told me. But neither did she want to be like her dad or her older brother. When she was younger, she was into princess dresses, art and eye shadow, and she knew she expressed herself “differently from really, like, everybody I went to school with.” She didn’t cohere in one tidy prefab identity package. And she didn’t really care. Antonio also always knew she wanted to be a YouTuber and do makeup tutorials. But when she actually started doing them, she also realized she wanted to do makeup tutorials and not talk about makeup. By 2018, this was a viable, scrutable social enterprise, in the same way that it became a viable enterprise for Jon Stewart to make comedy shows that were no longer focused on comedy. “People will look at this and say, ‘Oh, this is beauty content — like, the purpose of this content is for people to learn beauty tips,’ ” Kevin Allocca, YouTube’s head of culture and trends, told me. But the truth is, once people who grew up watching makeup tutorials began creating their own makeup tutorials, the form started to morph. “You peel back a layer, and the beauty stuff becomes this convention that allows you to have another set of interactions and discussions.” In response to her sudden fame, Antonio gave up a little — on looks, on life — and started wearing almost no makeup to school except fake eyelashes (and yes, she knows some people think it’s a big deal to wear lashes to school, but they take her only three minutes and they make her look more presentable, so). Her grades also fell into the dumpster. At that point, her mother relented and let her enroll in online school. Holed up in her room for even more hours a day, Antonio kept making videos. In them, her mother occasionally reaches an arm into Antonio’s bedroom and deposits a mug of tea on her bureau. Or Antonio orders Taco Bell. Or Antonio rotates through Wagner’s entire Ring Cycle of emotions while dying her hair pink . The dramas are grand, banal, earnest and unapologetically boring. Antonio then edits them with frantic cuts, subtitles introducing bald sincerity (“I am not O.K.”), X-ray filters, horror genre music and satirical product placement that is also product placement. “I’m like, Oh, this is what happens when someone is raised on the internet,” one 23-year-old friend said to me when I asked him to explain, “like this person grew up thinking in GIFs.” The result is sui generis — relatable and a relief, yes, to the young, but also panic-inducing. We all know we’re disjointed schizoid selves deep inside, yet aren’t we supposed to leave these selves in the bathroom mirror? Antonio insists that she’s the same in person as she is online, and it’s true. On a Thursday morning this fall when she opened the front door to her very decorated-for-Halloween house, she was dressed in an oversize T-shirt that covered her shorts, and we sat and talked in her bedroom while she did her makeup. Antonio was feeling a little overwhelmed. She was behind in physics, and behind in calculus, and she knew she needed to grind so she did not fail her classes and get kicked out of online school. But at the same time she needed to post to Instagram . This was a professional, not emotional, need: That day she was releasing “merch,” big black cotton sweatshirts with a single small orange pumpkin embroidered on the front. But posting on Instagram was stressful, like really so stressful, because if a post didn’t receive that many likes — which for Antonio was between zero and 600,000 — then Antonio felt bad about it and wanted to delete it. But deleting a post also looked bad, because it revealed that you cared a pathetic amount about what other people thought. (If a post receives between 650,000 and 900,000 likes, Antonio will keep it up; she can always tell within 10 minutes, honestly five minutes, how a post is going to perform.) So after Antonio finished her look — pink half cut-creases around her eyes, glinting contours on her cheeks, nose and upper lip — and misted her face with setting spray, she moved over to her unmade bed to Facetune her photos. “I know some YouTubers who will post pictures of themselves taken straight from their phones, and they’re doing fine,” Antonio said. “They’re probably mentally doing amazing.” But she has a process: First, she gets rid of her acne. Then she color-corrects her neck, removes flyaway hairs, narrows her jawline, straightens her nose, plumps her lips — digital, as opposed to analog, cosmetics, essentially. Then she moves the image over to the VSCO app to use its filters. “I’m not a VSCO girl,” she said. “Well, maybe I am.” Part of the terror of the internet, for the olds, is that this technology exploits flaws in our thinking. Pre-internet, the prevailing belief was that we had real selves and fake selves, and we cast judgment on the fakes. We took for granted that we should at least try to present ourselves to the world as coherent people with unified personalities. An avatar could only mean trouble (and often did): an alter ego, an outlet, for the excised bits; a convenient, nearly irresistible portal for the parts of ourselves we had repressed. This foundational (maybe Puritan?) belief in the integrated self has been helpful, even necessary, in real life, because in real life we need to deal with one another in time and space. Thus it’s nice if our fellow humans are predictable, and you have some idea of what you’ll be dealing with when a person shows up. There are whole branches of psychology dedicated to trying to help us keep ourselves together. And, of course, rafts of diagnoses — bipolar, schizophrenia, multiple personality, borderline personality — for those of us who fail to do this well. And yet, at the same time, we know it’s a ruse. We are, all of us, deeply, inalienably contradictory and chaotic. In the practical world, we pretend it’s not true. But in art, if people capture this multidimensionality beautifully enough — “Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself” — we herald their genius and praise them for it. This chaos — this cubism, this unleashing of our multiple selves — is a feature, not a bug, of the online world. It’s arguably its defining characteristic for those who grew up there. You could attribute all the jump cuts, all the endlessly iterating memes, to a destroyed attention span. But it’s also evidence of something deeper, a mind-set people are just trying to name. The Dutch cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker settled on the term metamodernism , a cultural position they claim is defined by neither modernism’s essential optimism nor postmodernism’s irony and mistrust, but as an “oscillation, an unsuccessful negotiation, between two opposite poles.” The sensibility is, as Luke Turner, a British artist and the author of “The Metamodernist Manifesto,” puts it, “a kind of informed naïveté, a pragmatic idealism, a moderate fanaticism, oscillating between sincerity and irony, deconstruction and construction, apathy and affect, attempting to attain some sort of transcendent position, as if such a thing were within our grasp.” It is nostalgic and cynical, knowing and naïve; manipulative, manipulated and spontaneous. Arguably it is the dominant postapocalyptic vision of our digital times, the internet’s McLuhan moment, brought to us by teenagers who, as such, spend their days feeling like 10 different people at once and believe they can, and should, express them all. We all contain multitudes. The kids seem to know that’s all right. Elizabeth Weil is a writer at large for the magazine. She last wrote a profile of Venus Williams.

Suzy Hansen,"On Saturday, April 29, 2017, Turkey banned Wikipedia. This came as a shock, even in a country with a history of banning everything from novels (Albert Camus’s “The Plague,” from public schools in 1987) to films (“Nymphomaniac,” in 2014) to entire genres of music ( arabesk , from state channels in the ’70s and ’80s). Previously, Turkey’s checks on the Turkish-language version of Wikipedia were limited to blocking only specific entries — like “vagina,” “human penis” and “2015 Turkey general election polls.” Someone in Turkey who followed a link to such a page would simply find it didn’t work. But why did the whole thing have to go? Syria, it turned out, was the proximate inspiration. Wikipedia pages with headers like “State-sponsored terrorism” and “Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War” seemed to accuse the Turkish government of supporting ISIS — “a smear campaign,” according to officials. Some months later, after the full block went into effect, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz identified other entries that the government considered offensive: One was about 57,000 emails tied to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law Berat Albayrak, which implicated him in having had indirect business relationships with ISIS; another entry, about “Benevolent Dictators,” like Napoleon and Fidel Castro, included Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey’s founding father. The government said it was banning Wikipedia, according to the law that allowed it to do so, for the protection of public order or national security. This article is part of a special issue of The New York Times Magazine about the future of the internet. For many years, the government had been more ad hoc in its policing of the internet. Then in 2007, Turkey’s Parliament, controlled by the still-young A.K. Party, passed a law numbered 5651, or “Regulation of Publications on the Internet and Suppression of Crimes Committed by Means of Such Publication.” Yaman Akdeniz, a Turkish cyberlaw expert, has noted that it passed after only 59 minutes of discussion. Around that time, one of the government’s many concerns was YouTube: Some users had reportedly said offensive things about Ataturk, including the claim that he was gay. When Turkish citizens complained about the insult — Penal Code Article 301 makes it a crime to insult Ataturk, Turkey or Turkishness — an Ankara court banned YouTube entirely. The president at the time, Abdullah Gul, would later tweet that he didn’t support the ban. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister, confessed that he had himself found ways to get on YouTube anyway. Those were the good old days. That was the era I moved to Turkey. The deep skepticism that many Turks had toward their institutions — courts, police, politicians, newspapers — was apparent. Military regimes had been intervening in the country’s affairs for most of its existence, and despite democratically elected governments, a diverse media and outspoken artists and activists, the state always controlled some of the information in the country and persecuted those who defied its manipulation. Turks were used to wading through the propaganda, counterpropaganda and the heroic efforts of native truth tellers, sorting bits of insanity and logic into their respective mental bins. They had their own ways of judging whether a court ruling or a newspaper headline was accurate or fair: These depended on their previous knowledge of the traditions and biases of an institution, or on their politics, their sources of information, their common sense. Some fell prey or willingly succumbed to the official state line; those who rejected it were compelled to question everything, as if interrogating the very contours of reality. The Turks were perhaps more prepared than many to deal with two of the most bewildering new features of what is now our shared global predicament: the chaos of the internet and the populist subterfuge of one-man regimes. But in recent years, both have accelerated to a scary degree in Turkey. What was once a semi-predictable stranglehold on official information has become a chaotic, repressive race to protect Erdogan’s interests. Much of this repression is by now well known. Hundreds of journalists have been jailed or fled the country in fear; hundreds more abandoned the profession; there is no longer an independent media in Turkey, save for a few small newspapers and websites; fake news is rampant. But the scale of Erdogan’s censorship works in far more diverse and insidious ways than most outsiders will ever understand. Erdogan is on TV and the radio so often — even a quick pop-in for a container of milk at the store means having to hear his voice — that it is very likely many Turks get their news directly from his mouth. That leaves one public space where people in Turkey go to hash out the truth: the internet, though the Erdogan government has been doing its best to make it both a duller and more dangerous place. Turning points came in 2013 and 2014, when two events genuinely threatened Erdogan’s hold on power. The first was the Gezi Park protests, in which thousands of people all across the country demonstrated against environmental destruction and police violence; social media was often used to agitate for more dissent. The other was the release of taped recordings that seemed to expose the shady business practices of Erdogan and his allies. By 2014, the government’s requests to Twitter and Facebook to remove users’ accounts spiked. Following the attempted military coup in 2016, Turkey has become one of the world’s harsher regimes when it comes to internet censorship. Turks can be hounded on Twitter by violent pro-Erdogan trolls or be detained by the police for a tweet, for a Facebook post, for a joke, for a casual outburst that can be taken as “insulting” the president. The government censors whole websites and platforms at will. It has in the past shut down YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. According to a report produced by the Turkey-based Freedom of Expression Association, nearly 250,000 sites are inaccessible without virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, which get users around regional restrictions. In 2018, Turkey sent 1,105 court orders to Twitter, compared with Russia and Brazil, which sent 372 and 107 orders. Turkey has asked Google to remove content more than 9,000 times in the last 10 years. It was supposedly because Wikipedia repeatedly rebuffed requests to remove things that the government decided to ban the site completely. This past summer, Turkey gave its broadcasting ministry oversight of the entire internet, including sites like Netflix, as well as local Netflix analogues like PuhuTV and BlueTV. This time, it wasn’t Erdogan tapes or gibes against Ataturk that caused the panic; one of the causes for panic was homosexuality. Pro-government newspapers cited “Orange Is the New Black,” “Stranger Things,” “El Chapo,” “Narcos” and “Black Mirror” as troubling cheerleaders for homosexuality, even calling Netflix a purveyor of “moral terrorism.” The oversight means that even news sites may have to obtain operating licenses from the broadcasting ministry. The human rights lawyer Kerem Altiparmak called the move the “biggest step in Turkish censorship history.” Every country’s mode of censorship varies in both severity and focus, and every society has its own ways of dealing with it. Turkey is not China, where Twitter is banned (though defiantly used by a small community), and yet it is a place where someone can be arrested for a tweet. Turkey’s style of censorship reflects its weird authoritarian-democratic state of being: The president’s office controls much of Turkish life, and yet the Turkish people can vote his party out of office in a mayoral election. Turks can be detained by the police for a Facebook post, but Facebook still exists. The most insidious and damaging effect of this political purgatory is that many Turks may not even know what information they are missing. I don’t want to exaggerate the degree to which censorship in Turkey affects the daily search for facts. Turks can easily find everyday information: the size of an earthquake tremor, the source of a fire in a nearby neighborhood, the value of their often-depreciating lira. In 2016, they figured out in minutes that a military coup was underway. The internet is so vast that even if you censor one website, people can find an alternative one. This government’s censorship is now often focused on subject areas that threaten the government: the failing economy, expressions of sympathy for people linked to “terrorism,” claims of corruption — and anything to do with Erdogan’s family. In the past, the Turkish state had a greater ideology to uphold; Erdogan has made censorship also about himself. If a piece of news doesn’t suit him, his government sees no reason it should exist. For ordinary people who want the details on their leadership and the fate of their country, once a website or article is censored, blocked, otherwise disappeared, they must engage in cat-and-mouse games to find a still extant link or an alternative news source before those, too, are censored. After the Wikipedia ban went into effect, for example, the news spread quickly in Turkey that if you just typed a “0” or “1” before a Wikipedia link — 0wikipedia.org or 1wikipedia.org — you could still connect to the site. But this workaround game can also favor those who speak foreign languages and have money. Turks evade many bans with V.P.N.s, but they’re good only for those who can afford them or put up with the glitchiness of the cheaper ones. Turks might also seek out information on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Periscope, or their own local sites like Dogruluk Payi or Teyit, whose mission is to fact-check the news. They might resort to WhatsApp groups where, perhaps even semiconsciously, they crowdsource information and dissect the latest news themselves. For the past decade, the watchdog organization Freedom House has analyzed digital liberty in dozens of countries, now home to 87 percent of the world’s online population. Its 2019 report, published Nov. 5, found a continuing global trend of increasing internet oppression by the usual suspects — Russia and China — but also long-term declines in internet freedom in countries like France and the United States. Active Freedom Iceland and other countries that top the charts have laws that favor open discussion and protect users. Slow Erosion Several strong democracies, including the United States and France, have seen freedoms degrade over the past decade. In France, crackdowns on extremist websites followed terror attacks. Swing States India and other countries in the middle of the chart are figuring out their internet regulations and might move either way in the future. Digital Revolution In Sri Lanka and Gambia, new governments resulted in swift increases in freedoms. Shutdown Fights Russia experienced protests for blocking social platforms like Telegram, slowing the state’s curtailment. The China Model Recently, China has held censorship training sessions for international authorities, exporting its brand of internet repression to the world. One homegrown Turkish website, called Eksi Sozluk, which means Sour Dictionary, could be called the Turkish Wikipedia. (In fact, it appeared online two years before Wikipedia.) It differs from its more famous cousin in significant ways: Rather than allowing users to collectively edit one dictionary entry, it encourages select contributors to add whatever entry they want, in the form of a list. Eksi Sozluk’s founder, a self-taught programmer and former software engineer at Microsoft named Sedat Kapanoglu, once explained: “The ones who consume the information provide it themselves — something very different from what we had seen in our education life in Turkey. To us, the textbook was the authority.” In effect, Eksi Sozluk is not only an online dictionary but also a record of the Turkish people’s quest to define their own lives. It is also a chronicle of their frustrations and their humor. There are about 10 headlines on Eksi Sozluk concerning the 2017 Wikipedia ban: “29 April 2017 Wikipedia Access Ban,” “29 April 2017 Reason for Wikipedia Access Ban” and so on. Some entries on the subject include technical, historically accurate information. But many entries are simply jokes, small acts of defiance: In Turkey, there’s no need for information. Everyone knows a ton. And: How nice it is to feel this freedom everywhere. More often than not, the very censoring of articles serves as a weird confirmation of the truth of their content (even if they’re not true). The specificity behind removing a Wikipedia page like “2015 Turkey general election polls,” for example, suggests that the ruling A.K. Party didn’t want the Turks to know that it was doing poorly in the 2015 elections. Recently, when some websites and newspapers reported a rumor about the personal life of the president’s son-in-law and those sites promptly disappeared into the ether, a friend, after admitting to clicking on “so many” headlines, said: “If they went to all that trouble to remove it, then you think it must be true.” Taking down a website because of its lame gossip reminds Turks that at all times they could be punished for even the most minor infractions on Facebook or Twitter — or in any other realm of life. The government doesn’t necessarily succeed in preventing its people from learning or reading or watching things. But it succeeds in letting its citizens know that there are limits to their personal freedom. The people in Turkey who want to produce or consume truth end up doing so online or in their living rooms, among friends and family, huddling together and preserving their little spaces of sanity, a million bunkers of truth waiting for the abusive storm to pass. There are moments of collective reckoning with the truth, however. Earlier this year, just before a mayoral election in Istanbul, a financial crisis led to soaring food prices. Pro-government media channels for the most part played down the crisis. But Turks going to the bazaar or the grocery store found they could no longer afford fruits and vegetables. Low-budget videos appeared on social media showing something that Turks rarely saw in the mainstream press: the intensity of the anger at the government. These videos featured a single reporter with a mic standing somewhere in Istanbul — often in neighborhoods far from the more prosperous city center — asking people whom they planned to vote for. Many were elderly or mothers or fervent supporters of Erdogan. They yelled about the prices of tomatoes and onions, about the tax on plastic grocery-shopping bags. All of a sudden, it felt as if the mayoral candidate from Erdogan’s A.K. Party could actually lose the election — an unthinkable outcome in a city his party had ruled for 25 years. And in fact, the A.K. Party candidate lost. It came as a surprise to everyone, even if they’d seen the videos. Anyone could have heard those complaints all over town, it’s true. The street is perhaps one of Turkey’s last great bastions for both reliable gossip and facts. But the impact of seeing women on a screen complaining about onions was electrifying. The videos were a reminder of what a diverse media, a free internet, is supposed to do — bring the world to the people. In those moments, seeing real life on a screen again, Turks might have been reminded, after years of media censorship and the government’s relentless production of its desired reality, how little they knew about their fellow Turks anymore. That ignorance — and the appeal of its antidote — may be especially prevalent during wartime. In October, Turkey invaded Syria, and the war against information in Turkey reached a new pitch. The most repressive measures against the internet have always focused on the government’s enemies — primarily the P.K.K., or the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, and often anyone affiliated with the fight for Kurdish rights. In 2015, during the war in the southeast against the P.K.K., the government shut down all internet service in specific locations across the region. Turks heard only snippets of horrific stories from the front lines. Much of the despair activists expressed during that time had to do with the feeling that they might never know what happened in the southeast at all. As soon as Turkey invaded northern Syria in October, the government repeated some of these measures, including disrupting social media networks like Facebook and Twitter in spots along the Syrian border, like Hatay and Gaziantep. “We will not tolerate broadcasts that serve the purpose of terrorism,” the Turkish Supreme Council for Radio and Television announced, “that might mislead our citizens with false and biased information.” As the Turkish military moved into Syria, a new English-language website appeared in Turkey called Duvar English. The Turkish version of the site had been one of the last remaining relatively free and independent sources of information and opinion; the English-language site signaled greater ambitions. Many of its editors, columnists and journalists had either been fired by or pushed out of Turkish newspapers and universities. In its first days, a few of the columnists wrote about censorship and its effects. “War’s first casualty is truth,” the editor in chief Cansu Camlibel wrote in her inaugural column, quoting an American politician from the 1910s. Another columnist, Mehves Evin, tried to posit exactly what was being lost in this conflict. Since the invasion, she noted, some 186 Turks had been taken into custody for comments made online; 28 were imprisoned. The Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office of Istanbul and the General Directorate of Security issued a warning “that any news, analysis or social media comments ‘targeting the Turkish army and its operation, attempting to destroy public peace and unity,’ would be investigated under Turkey’s Penalty Code and Anti Terror Law.” Even more sinister, the Interior Ministry had announced that something called “cyber units” were patrolling “social media 7/24.” “Those voices urging peace and pointing out that military intervention will destabilize the country can only be heard in alternative digital media,” Evin wrote. If so, “one might wonder whether the vast majority of Turkish society really is opposed to the prospect of a peaceful solution.” Even if you believe most Turks backed the invasion, it’s hard to miss Evin’s point. After so many years of censorship, who is to say what anyone really feels or believes in Turkey anymore? By what method would anyone even gather and represent those feelings? During the Istanbul mayoral election, the country surprised itself, and its citizens surprised one another. During the war in Syria, it has made sense to ask how much of the country does not reflexively support Erdogan’s foreign war. There is no way to know. A heavily censored society not only loses access to information; it ceases to know itself. The greatest loss the Turks face under Erdogan might be their knowledge of one another. There is another loss, an international one. What was striking about the advent of Duvar English was how often more than one columnist described the challenge of transmitting news and information to the West. “Ten years ago, it was impossible to translate Turkey for the foreign audience,” the columnist Ece Temelkuran wrote. “It wasn’t because we the English-speaking Turks didn’t have the vocabulary; it was because what we went through politically simply did not make sense to the Western audience.” She also asked: “When some nations are written off as lost, is there really such a thing as a connected humanity left on the planet? And if my country is now treated as one of those crazy countries where anything can happen, is it still worth trying to write in this language of strangers?” Her sentiments are ones I hear with increasing regularity in Turkey, from those who feel the foreign news about Turkey is so obsessed with Erdogan as the all-powerful, evil authoritarian that they miss the country’s many complexities, of even the government and especially of the opposition. Foreigners, above all Westerners, are disposed to ascribe the tendencies of the ruler and the deteriorating state of a democracy to the people themselves. A country enduring authoritarian rule can be simply dismissed, written off as a place “lost” to humanity, as a “crazy country.” But it’s the country — the people — who have been the ones persevering, hoping for better, protecting their bunkers of truth and facts for the future. The columnists at Duvar English were reminding the West that even though their voices were being silenced, that did not mean the rest of the world should stop listening.

Jim Motavalli,"At a glance, this topless 1974 Ford Bronco looks every part the classic S.U.V. it is. But pop the hood and discover a supercharged 700-horsepower Coyote V-8 engine, whose low, throaty rumble helped draw a crowd to the Bronco’s parking spot outside the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. The time warp continues inside, where contemporary creature comforts await. An infotainment system? Check. Fancy carpeting and heated seats? A six-speed automatic shifter? Yes to all that, and to its complete lack of drama. Unlike some high-performance cars of the period, the Bronco doesn’t overheat or refuse to idle smoothly, and it handles and stops much better than any 1970s Ford product ever did. Climbing into a cab raised more than five inches was simple, thanks to running boards that slide out when the doors are opened. And 16 miles per gallon combined isn’t terrible, considering the power on tap. The Bronco is a so-called restomod, a fast-growing category of autos built not just for gearheads who like to get under the hood but for families that simply like the look of old cars . “Everyone loves the old look,” said Ken Lingenfelter, who acquired his first Corvette in 1977 and builds high-performance engines for them and other sporty models at his operations in Michigan. “And the cars where every nut and bolt is right, they’ve always done well at auctions and become the gold standard. “But when you drive your collector car,” he added, “you want it to be able to have reliable air conditioning, to be able to stop correctly and to run without smelling like gasoline all the time.” Gateway Bronco of Hamel, Ill., restored the 1974 vehicle with up-to-the-minute technology, and it is headed for a Barrett-Jackson charity auction in mid-January at a list price of $348,060 as equipped, but could sell for more. The customers in this market, some of them much younger than the average classic car owner , are willing to pay premium prices. Most restomods are based on American performance cars, like Corvettes, Camaros, Mustangs and Chargers, but some European and Japanese vehicles are joining in the trend. “People like restomods because they’re so useful,” said Seth Burgett, president and chief executive of Gateway Bronco, as well as the owner of several Shelby Mustangs . “Anyone in the family can just get in and drive them.” Some owners commute in their cars, something rarely done with authentically restored classics, and others use them for Sunday drives or park them at the vacation home. In short, they get used. Of course, restoring old cars to anything other than their factory specifications is sacrilege to some, but market trends are proving that many of today’s buyers didn’t get that memo. “We are starting to see some categories where the restomods are actually selling higher than original, matching-numbers cars,” said Craig Jackson, chairman and chief executive of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company, via email. “Because people want to drive and enjoy them.” He said baby boomers were still the largest market for the more expensive restomods, but the number of Generation X and millennial buyers is growing. Lance Stander, the chief of Superformance/Shelby Legendary Cars, which makes cars like the Ford GT40 and the Shelby Cobra under license, agreed. “Our buyers used to be mostly 55- and 60-year-olds who liked these cars when they were in college,” said Mr. Stander, whose company is in Irvine, Calif. “Now we’re getting kids with dreadlocks and young tech guys. They’re a lot younger, many of them under 40.” Troy Trepanier, who runs Rad Rides by Troy in Manteno, Ill., said business was booming for his high-ticket, mostly American cars. His custom builds start at $500,000 and average $750,000. Even at those prices, the shop has orders stretching out five or six years. “Our typical customer is someone who has been hands-on with cars,” Mr. Trepanier said. “They know what it takes to put together a vehicle like this, and they have the means to pay for, sometimes, more than one.” The auction house Gooding and Company specializes in cars that are either highly original or “correctly,” restored, but David Gooding, the chief and founder, said, “I see why there is a demand.” Mr. Gooding pointed out that American cars adapted readily to the treatment, because they tend to have the space for added components, such as larger engines, bigger wheels and add-on air-conditioning systems. While Detroit may be well represented in this genre, it crosses borders. Singer Vehicle Design in Sun Valley, Calif., restores and “reimagines” old Porsches, putting air-cooled engines of up to 390 horsepower in cars that look like the classic 1960s 911 but have lightweight carbon-fiber bodywork and a more modern Porsche base. Steven Davis, vice president for sales and client relations at Singer, said the company had 130 cars “in the field” and many more on order. Drew Coblitz, a 31-year-old consultant in Philadelphia, recently took delivery of a dark blue Singer-restored car, his second. “I really wanted something incredibly special that would stand out among the many expensive cars out today,” he said. “I like having something so major that is still kind of undercover.” Among Mr. Coblitz’s other cars are a Lamborghini Urus S.U.V. and a McLaren 600LT. Sometimes, the manufacturer does the modernizing. Between 1996 and 2009, Mercedes-Benz’s in-house performance division, AMG, modified 11 classic 300SL models (eight “Gullwings” and three roadsters) with modern six-liter, 381-horsepower V-8 engines, air conditioning, Recaro sport seats and other features. They all had airbags installed, too, Mercedes said. Given that Gullwings in their original state are scarce and highly prized, the auto site Motorious called one such conversion “a crime against classic cars.” A danger with restomods is overdoing it. Owners who have been too enthusiastic about imposing their personal tastes on the projects may be at a disadvantage at resale time. “You have to decide if you’re going to build it for the mass market or just for yourself,” Mr. Jackson said. “It’s easy to go overboard on customization.” Celebrities have been prominent buyers in this market, and an accident involving the actor and comedian Kevin Hart points to the cars’ safety issues. He was badly injured in September as a passenger in his 1970 Plymouth Barracuda, powered by a 720-horsepower Hellcat engine. The California Highway Patrol said that “a harness could have prevented or minimized the injuries that Kevin and the driver suffered.” Safety, including roll cages and harnesses, should definitely be — and usually are — part of the upgrade package for these cars, though installation of airbags requires complex engineering and is best left to manufacturers. Still, as Jay Leno, the comic and car enthusiast, pointed out in a Popular Mechanics column, “No matter how much you upgrade an antique car, it is never going to be as safe as a modern vehicle.”","Nov. 14, 2019",New York Times,NA,"Vintage Cars With Old Souls, and Touch Screens and A.C.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/business/collector-cars-restomods.html
Derrick Bryson Taylor,"Everything old is new again, sort of. Television shows from decades ago are getting the reboot treatment . Animated films from yesteryear are back in theaters with a digital makeover. And now the Razr, the unmistakable slim flip phone from the 2000s, has returned, hoping to ride the fad for foldable tech back into people’s pockets. Motorola announced the phone’s revival on Wednesday. Packed into its familiar retro clamshell design will be an Android operating system; two screens (a 6.2-inch touch-screen one on the inside and a 2.7-inch external one); and a lengthy list of other features that may or may not pull in millennials and lure away iPhone users. The price of this nostalgia is $1,499, slightly more than the most expensive version of Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max . Consumers can begin preordering the device on Dec. 26 through Verizon, according to a news release . The original Razr, released in 2004, came in nearly every color and was adored by millions for its sleek design. ( David Beckham even filmed a commercial for it .) In 2004, the aluminum device was the thinnest phone on the market, according to CNET . For many Razr users, angrily flipping the phone shut — no need to press “end” — was the best way to cut short an annoying call. A CNET reviewer summed up the device: “Streamlined. Utterly pocketable. Nostalgic, with a sharp futuristic edge.” The future of foldable phones was called into question this year after the release of Samsung’s Galaxy Fold . It generated a lot of attention, both for its design and its nearly $2,000 price, but it spiraled into a public-relations nightmare. Reviews slammed the screen’s quality and ultimately sank the phone’s reputation. Huawei is rolling out its Mate X foldable phone in China, but it has yet to hit the market in the United States. Sergio Buniac, the president of Motorola, told CNET that the company developed the new Razr after seeing a consumer need for foldable phones. “It’s not like we decided to relaunch the Razr and figured something out,” he said. Asked how the company would position the phone, given that it brings back memories for a certain generation but has no significance for today’s teenagers, Mr. Buniac said: “Foldable is a technology that’s starting. We believe there are so many options and avenues with that, so we have to think about new consumer segments as we move forward.” Mr. Buniac said he saw the Razr as a franchise. The phone was originally set to be released in the summer, but it was delayed until January. “We are two or three months behind,” Mr. Buniac said. “That’s O.K. It’s new technology. There are good days and bad days, but we want to feel that it’s really mature before going to market.” The company’s gambit seemed to be resonating with social media users on Thursday. One woman said on Twitter that her first thought about the phone’s release was “that’s hot,” a possible nod to Paris Hilton, a noted Razr user in the 2000s . “I loved my hot pink Razr man,” another woman said on Twitter. “Flipping that thing closed felt so powerful!” Others zeroed in on the price. “Loved the phone. Not the price,” one man on Twitter said of the new phone. Another man was more frank, calling the price “silly.” A review by Tech Radar said Motorola’s new Razr was a “bold experiment” for keeping an old look and added that the phone inherited the original version’s early reputation “as a pricey status symbol.” Digital Trends put it this way: “The Motorola Razr relies a lot on design and nostalgia to win over fans.”","Nov. 14, 2019",New York Times,NA,"The Razr’s Back, Flipping Open an Old Love Story",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/technology/motorola-razr-foldable-phone.html
Kate Conger,"Amazon on Thursday said it planned to officially challenge the Pentagon’s surprise decision last month to award a $10 billion cloud-computing contract to Microsoft, setting off another legal battle over the lucrative, decade-long project. Amazon said it had notified a federal court of its plans to protest the government’s decision. In a statement, a spokesman for the company suggested that the contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, known as JEDI, was awarded based on political motivations. “It’s critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders administer procurements objectively and in a manner that is free from political influence,” said Drew Herdener, the Amazon spokesman, in the statement. “Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors and unmistakable bias — and it’s important that these matters be examined and rectified,” he said. Amazon had been considered the front-runner for the contract, partly because it had built cloud services for the Central Intelligence Agency. It is also the country’s biggest cloud computing provider. But President Trump said publicly that other “great companies” should have a chance at the contract. Mr. Trump has openly criticized Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, who also owns The Washington Post. The president has accused the paper of spreading “fake news.” A speechwriter for Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary, says in a book published recently that Mr. Trump had wanted to give the contract to another company. It would be improper for a president to intervene in the awarding of a contract, according to experts on federal contracting. The Defense Department said it would not speculate on potential litigation. A spokesman for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The JEDI contract is significant for the military and for technology companies that are increasingly seeking government business. The military frequently operates on outdated computer systems, and the Defense Department has spent billions of dollars on modernization efforts. Microsoft’s victory in the contracting process has the potential to reshape the cloud computing industry, in which Amazon is the dominant player. It could also establish Microsoft as the first choice for government agencies, putting it in prime position to win the roughly $40 billion that the federal government is expected to spend on cloud services over the next few years, analysts said. Daniel Ives, the managing director of Wedbush Securities, said Amazon’s protest “was to be expected, given how significant the JEDI deal is.” While new information about Mr. Trump’s actions could emerge, he said, he believes the protest was unlikely to change the result of the bid award, because “this is the most scrutinized contract D.O.D. has ever had.” Mr. Ives said Amazon’s protest would prompt an internal Pentagon review that he expects to take 45 to 60 days and will delay the beginning of work by Microsoft. The decision is likely to be taken to court by the loser, but work should begin on the cloud contract as the court battle plays out.

Taylor Lorenz,"This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series , which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve. LOS ANGELES — FaZe Clan could be called a media company, or an esports team, or an influencer marketing agency, or all of the above. “Something like who we are has never existed before,” said Lee Trink, the organization’s chief executive. He comes from the entertainment world (he helped discover Kid Rock) and his best attempt is to describe FaZe Clan is the Dallas Cowboys meets Supreme meets MTV. But it’s more than that: a direct-to-consumer e-commerce business, releasing merchandise and apparel; an in-house content production studio; a talent-management business; a sales team acting as a mini advertising agency negotiating brand deals; and a technology arm that develops software to meet the demands of talent. Teenagers find this corporate conglomerate incredibly cool. FaZe Clan fans get FaZe tattoos , doodle FaZe logos on their notebooks at school and show up outside the group’s Hollywood Hills house begging for pictures. When a group of members visited SoHo in New York City this summer, multiple city blocks were closed after thousands of fans flooded the streets . This weekend, they’ll open their first storefront , on Melrose Ave. in Los Angeles, and it threatens to be a “legendary moment,” as a FaZe member put it. FaZe Clan consists of 34 content creators and 15 professional esports players, and 11 hybrid creators who are both pro players and entertainers . All of them excel at creating social media clips; together they have brought 214 million viewers into the fold. Members are easy to recognize online. They refer to themselves using their gamer tags, which always start with “FaZe.” There’s FaZe Banks, 27; FaZe Temperrr, 24; FaZe Rain, 23; and FaZe Apex, 23, four early members considered the backbone of the organization. FaZe Kay, a 23-year-old British Twitch star and gamer with 3.2 million subscribers on YouTube, joined in 2014. His younger brother, FaZe Jarvis, is the resident baby brother of the FaZe house and often the butt of pranks. (He once won a Fortnite game with a boa constrictor coiled around his neck .) Jarvis also might be the first great casualty of the organization. He recently received a lifetime ban from Fortnite . That game has been his ticket to top tier employment and his source of fame. He is now deciding what’s next . “I’ve just been taking a lot of time to reflect on everything,” he told his subscribers a few days ago. He is 17. FaZe Clan moved to Los Angeles in 2016, first to Newport, then to Calabasas and, in 2018, into dual 12,500-square-foot mansions in the Hollywood Hills. One house is full of strictly FaZe members. The other contains a roving cast of FaZe- adjacent influencers, like RiceGum (a model and rapper) and Sommer Ray (a fitness model). The houses act as live-in dorms for influencers. During the day, they work. One day in October, Vera Salamone , FaZe Clan’s director of talent, conducted a 10 a.m. stand-up meeting. She asked the boys  what they planned to accomplish during the day. “I have meetings, then I’m making a video with Jarvis. Getting ready for the weekend. I just want a day off,” said FaZe Kay. Everyone laughed. After the meeting, the gamers slumped off into their rooms to begin the daily grind. Most FaZe Clan members spend the majority of their time in their bedrooms, posted up in front of their gaming stations. “I spent 90 percent of my time here in my room,” said FaZe Kay. “There’s not much you can really do,” he continued. “All I do is play Fortnite anyway. I sit in my set up and play, so I’m not really too bothered. I don’t even really go outside too much.” Many members played varsity sports in high school. They are obsessed with fitness and nutrition. The third-floor common area of the current FaZe house is dedicated to a gym. “We aren’t shy, antisocial quote unquote weird kids that are out of shape, don’t play sports, don’t mess with girls and don’t eat well,” said Banks. “We do all that stuff.” FaZe Clan members make things for their channels, the collective FaZe channels, or for brands. This year FaZe has done advertising deals with Fortune 500 brands including Nissan and Burger King . (For Burger King, some of them ate burgers blindfolded for a video and appeared surprised to find out that they were not made of meat. “That’s lit,” said FaZe Cizzorz .) The FaZe Clan house proper is sprawling, with white marble floors and metallic silver railings. It is also empty, devoid of personal belongings. A neon FaZe logo hangs by the TV above the fireplace. There’s a pool table that remains untouched. TV screens around the house display live counts and rankings of members’ YouTube, Twitch and Instagram followings. Gamers flop around on oversized bean bag chairs that litter the top floor, the default common area . The unofficial uniform is FaZe Clan merch paired with designer sportswear and brand-name slides . “These are Louis Vuitton sliders,” FaZe Jarvis said when asked about his footwear. “I have three pairs of sliders: Off-White, Louis and Givenchy ones.” His older brother was decked out in  Gucci. They aren’t particularly into fashion, the brothers said. They just buy nice things because they can. FaZe Clan members block out the neighborhood’s breathtaking views with thick blinds to prevent glare. The rooms feel like packed caves. Beds are generally unmade and in various states of disarray. FaZe Temperrr has the largest room in the house. Larger than a small New York City apartment, it’s crammed with piles of personal items: a box of Travis Scott limited-edition Reese’s Puffs, a Gucci wallet, a plush Mario doll. His mantle is covered with anime figurines and childhood photos. FaZe Barry , Temperrr’s Bengal cat, roams his huge marble bathroom. FaZe Kay keeps a Boring company fire extinguisher on his bedside table, propped up against his gold YouTube play button plaque, awarded when he reached 1 million followers. Empty Arrowhead water bottles are clustered around the plaque like prayer candles. FaZe Jarvis’s room is the one notable exception. It’s spotless and completely empty aside from a Dyson fan, his own YouTube play button plaque, also on his bedside table. Outside FaZe Jarvis’s room is the entrance to the house’s private movie theater, compete with a bar and a stripper pole on an elevated platform. Several members said one big misconception of life in the house is how monotonous some days can be. “People think it’s a lot crazier than it is because people see nothing but highlights,” said FaZe Teeqo . FaZe Clan members have a specific type of fame, an experience similar to teen stars and YouTubers. To anyone under the age of 20, they’re almost immediately recognizable. To adults they look like average kids. Most can get around L.A. without much hassle. “If you go to a mall on a Saturday, it’s not going to be too good,” said FaZe Teeqo. “But if I got to Trader Joe’s 10 a.m. on a Tuesday, it’s fine.” FaZe Clan made a name for itself by embracing influencer culture and taking a social media content-first approach to gaming . Back in 2010, Call of Duty (COD), a first-person shooter game, was wildly popular. While many top COD players focused on winning tournaments and accolades, FaZe Banks, FaZe Temperrr and other early FaZe members became famous for trickshotting. That’s when a player invents creative stunts in a game, sometimes to the detriment of their performance. It’s jumping off a building while spinning around 360 degrees and shooting someone on your way down. Sure, you died, but it looked cool. FaZe players would put these outrageous highlights on YouTube and promptly go viral. FaZe Banks, a former lacrosse player who began playing COD in 2009, mastered YouTube early. His first video, a tutorial on how to hack your Xbox score, generated $800 in ad revenue. “It was my moment where I was like, wait a second, there’s a lot of money to be made on the internet,” Banks said, “and my internet hustle was video games.” Just a handful of YouTubers had reached a million followers by then. “We were the first gamers really showing our faces on the internet,” said FaZe Temperrr. They inserted small reaction shots and narration over gameplay. Members also began vlogging, showcasing their daily nongaming lives. “People loved it,” Banks said. “People had something to follow outside the gameplay. They play COD every day, but now they get to see the lifestyle we live and that we’re cool kids.” In 2012, they began a traditional esports team, pairing panache and trickshotting and social media prowess with top gameplay talent. They quickly began racking up trophies. For most of FaZe Clan’s existence it had no corporate structure. “As soon as I met these guys, I was like, this is an incredible business, but there’s no infrastructure,” said Greg Selkoe , the organization’s president. The members of FaZe had fostered a fandom of millions online, but they weren’t effectively converting their audience numbers into cash. Last year, Mr. Selkoe and Mr. Trink signed on full time.  Now, about 70 people work for FaZe Clan on the business side. It took on a round of outside investment a year ago, and has welcomed celebrity members like Lil Yachty and Offset , who also invested. In September, the company announced a partnership with Manchester City , an elite soccer team. Their job is to create content around the sports franchise and to partner on merchandise. Just as Supreme was birthed from skateboarding culture, FaZe Clan hopes to establish a gaming-adjacent apparel business. It recently collaborated with Champion, New Era and 24karats, a high-fashion Japanese clothing line. Expansion efforts haven’t been without speed bumps. “If there’s multiple ways to do something, FaZe will do the craziest way,” said Mr. Trink. L ast year, a now-defunct social media company and former officemate sued the company for an undisclosed amount in excess of $1 million for “intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and misappropriation of trade secrets.” In May, Turner Tenney , one of the top Fortnite players in the world, sued FaZe Clan in a contract dispute . Mr. Tenney, known online as Tfue, said that FaZe had signed him into a predatory agreement in which the company could take up to 80 percent of his earnings in certain cases, and was violating California law by illegally operating as a talent agency. FaZe counter sued . Their litigation continues . “We’ve spent most of the past year getting our stuff together,” Mr. Trink said. “FaZe Clan was built by kids, the youngest being 14 at the time,” he added. “They didn’t think about potential lawsuits.” Among the cleanup: retroactively filing trademarks and revamping the way contracts are structured. They are also focused on recruiting its next generation of talent. This year, FaZe Clan welcomed FaZe H1ghSky1 , a 12-year-old gamer from Seattle, and FaZe Ew0k , a 13-year-old deaf Fortnite competitor and the first female member. FaZe Clan’s membership has remained predominantly male. Banks says he is desperate to change the perception that gaming is primarily for teen boys. “Everyone is a gamer. You play games on your phone? You’re a gamer,” he said. “My mom who plays Farmville is gamer. Sports is a gaming mentality. If you’ve ever played a sport, you’re a gamer.” The company, also, has an opportunity to offer more women’s apparel. T raditional esports teams, like OpTic , have taken a page out of FaZe’s playbook. They too are attempting to make more content and more personalities, not just win games. 100 Thieves , another company seeking to merge gaming and lifestyle, raised $35 million this summer. FaZe Clan’s relative scale, however, is staggering. FaZe Clan has more than 7.5 million followers on Instagram alone; 100 Thieves has 571,000. “As an organization they’ve got this incredible network effect,” said Sundance DiGiovanni , a co-founder of Major League Gaming. “When they bring someone in, that person sees an explosion on their social channels.” Like any average college-aged kid, FaZe Clan members like to have a good time. Some hit the clubs on the weekends or attend parties hosted by young Hollywood talent and fellow YouTube stars. Events at the FaZe Clan house itself have become infamous. Last year, the crew hosted a 900-person party with 700 young women. “Marshmello” — he’s a big D.J. — “said it was the best party he’s ever been to,” Temperrr said. In October, Banks and some friends caused an estimated $30,000 worth of damage to a hotel room at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas after a wild night. The less fun side is that burnout is a major concern for online creators . Nearly all top FaZe Clan members have experienced it. “It’s really hard to stay consistent with this level of work,” said FaZe Adapt. “There was a couple moments when it got hard. If I wasn’t posting every day, I was filming all day, editing all night.” In late October, FaZe Rain, one of the founding owner-members, posted a series of alarming messages on Twitter , and slammed fellow members of FaZe Clan for not being there for him. FaZe Rain had previously discussed struggling with depression, and revealed that he had suffered a “mental breakdown” that landed him in a psychiatric ward. “I’ve been doing this since I was 11 years old, man,” he said at the time, meaning making content for YouTube. Currently his social media output veers between “I feel like I lost myself” and, this week, “All you need is confidence then you can do anything.” FaZe Adapt and others have taken months offline to recuperate, but many members still regularly push themselves to the limit. “We work nonstop,” said FaZe Temperrr. “We’re well aware of what can happen if you don’t work hard. We’re at such a great point that if we we’re going to start slowing down , people would catch up and we wouldn’t have this opportunity again.” “If you don’t have your eyes on this, internet culture in general, esports, video games, if you still don’t take it seriously, you should. You need to wake up. Everyday we live more and more on the internet. If you can’t see where this is going you should pay more attention,” said Banks. “Eventually we will all live in the internet, and I want to exist in that world. That’s where I see us.”","Nov. 15, 2019",New York Times,NA,Can FaZe Clan Build a Billion-Dollar Business?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/style/faze-clan-house.html
Kate Murphy,"People worry that Big Brother and Big Tech are invading their privacy. But a more immediate concern may be the guy next door or a shifty co-worker. A growing array of so-called smart surveillance products have made it easy to secretly live-stream or record what other people are saying or doing. Consumer spending on surveillance cameras in the United States will reach $4 billion in 2023, up from $2.1 billion in 2018, according to the technology market research firm Strategy Analytics . Unit sales of consumer surveillance devices are expected to more than double from last year. The problem is all that gear is not necessarily being used to fight burglars or keep an eye on the dog while she’s home alone. Tiny cameras have been found in places where they shouldn’t be, like Airbnb rentals , public bathrooms and gym locker rooms . So often, in fact, that security experts warn that we are in the throes of a “bugging epidemic.” It is not paranoid to take precautions. A lot of spy gear is detectable if you know what to look for, said Charles Patterson, president of Exec Security , a firm in Tarrytown, N.Y., that specializes in corporate counterespionage. Look for anything in your surroundings that appears disturbed, out of place or odd. Surveillance can be done by more than clunky nanny cams. It can be conducted with wireless microdevices, some as small as a postage stamp, that can be stashed in hard-to-spot places like inside clocks, light fixtures and air vents. Be wary of anything with an inexplicable hole in it, like a hole drilled into a hair-dryer mount in a hotel bathroom. And scrutinize any wires trailing out of something that’s not obviously electronic, like a desk, a bookcase or a plant. “A basic physical inspection is something everybody can do,” Mr. Patterson said. Another low-cost way to spot surveillance equipment is turning off the lights and using a flashlight to scan a room to see if the lens of a camera shines back at you. If you don’t have a flashlight, look around using the front-facing camera on your smartphone (the side you use for video chats), which may allow you to see the otherwise invisible infrared light that spy cameras emit. A quick way to see if your phone’s camera detects infrared light is to look at your television remote through the viewfinder. If you can see a light flash on the tip of the remote when you press its buttons, you’re good to go. You can also download the Fing app on your smartphone, which when activated will show you all the devices connected to your Wi-Fi network. Anything that includes the name of a camera manufacturer — like Nest, Arlo or Wyze — or that the app flags as a possible camera is cause for concern. As is anything that you can’t readily identify. More sophisticated voyeurs may use spy gear that has its own hot spot for live streaming. So it’s a good idea to check for other Wi-Fi networks in the vicinity that have a strong signal. But that won’t help if the device is recording everything onto a tiny memory card for the peeper to retrieve later. If you want to be more comprehensive in your sweep, several do-it-yourself counter-surveillance tools are available. Among the easier-to-use devices are specially designed camera lens detectors . They cost $200 to $400 and emit a circle of superbright red LED strobe lights. When you scan the room looking through the viewfinder, even the tiniest camera lens will appear to blink back at you, giving away its location. “I used to sell mostly cameras, but in last few years it’s more detection devices,” said Jill Johnston, chief executive of KJB Security Products in Nashville. “There are just a lot more things to spy on you with. It’s really changing our business model, to be honest.” Also popular are radio frequency, or R.F., detectors that can pick up signals emitted by surveillance devices. While you can get them for as little as $40, the better models start at $300 and can cost as much as $8,000, depending on their ability to analyze and differentiate signals. Like old-fashioned metal detectors, R.F. detectors often produce a beep or tone that gets louder the closer you get to a transmitting radio signal. The more expensive versions have digital displays that detail the various radio frequencies detected and where they may be coming from. Most environments today are filled with radio signals. Unless you get the most expensive gear and the associated training offered by the manufacturer, you’re going to have a hard time knowing whether your place is bugged or you’re picking up a signal from your neighbor’s Wi-Fi or your wireless computer mouse or Bluetooth speaker. To reduce the number of false positives, security experts recommend first turning off or unplugging all your devices before you start your scan. Browsing Amazon and other online stores like Brickhouse Security and Spygadgets.com can also help. You’ll see that cameras and microphones don’t always look like cameras and microphones. They can look like smoke detectors, water bottles, air fresheners, cellphone chargers, pens, key chains, coffee makers, space heaters, birdhouses and plush toys. Of course, you can always get professional help. But a professional sweep of a home or an office can range from $1,500 to more than $10,000, depending on the size of the space, the number of nooks and crannies, and the amount of clutter. USA Bug Sweeps, a surveillance detection firm in Freehold, N.J., specializes in residential bug detection and does as many as three sweeps a day versus maybe one or two a week three years ago. Jimmie Mesis, the company’s chief executive, attributes the surge to recent news reports about cameras being hidden in homes by creepy landlords or handymen. “For every one camera that’s been found, there have probably been a hundred cameras that haven’t been found,” Mr. Mesis said.","Nov. 15, 2019, ",New York Times,NA,A Paranoid Guide to Fighting the ‘Bugging Epidemic’,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/technology/surveillance-bugging-protection.html
Jamie Condliffe,"Each week, we review the week’s news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Hi, I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news: I’m about to suggest something that sounds controversial: Maybe it’s good that we keep discovering biased algorithms? Let’s rewind. A pair of articles this past week revealed that software that is used to make decisions on the behalf of humans appears to do so with gender bias. First, it came to light that the algorithm that calculates credit quotas for Apple’s new credit card may give higher limits to men than to women. Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, said its credit decisions were “based on a customer’s creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.” And my colleague Cade Metz reported that artificial intelligence services from Google and Amazon both failed to recognize the word “hers” as a pronoun, but correctly identified “his.” Other, similar algorithms “generally don’t give women enough credit” when analyzing text, he added. This isn’t surprising. Algorithms are written by humans, who are inherently biased — and that can seep into the way they frame the analysis that underlies their code. Artificial intelligence software is trained on data that contains all kinds of human biases, which can then appear in its own inferences. “What algorithms are doing is giving you a look in the mirror,” Sandra Wachter, an associate professor in law and A.I. ethics at Oxford University, told me. “They reflect the inequalities of our society.” That we often see inequality is troubling. If software is going to choose a credit limit, it should do so fairly. If A.I. is supposed to parse information for us, we would like it to do so objectively. The problem is, algorithms are everywhere, making decisions on our behalf in ways that are often opaque to us. “How many times am I not seeing certain jobs ads? How many times do I get advertised higher prices?” Professor Wachter asked. “I often don’t know that I’m being treated unfairly.” In that sense, the more often we unearth cases of bias, the better. Because not only is it one algorithm fewer left unchecked, it’s more evidence to demonstrate why we must solve the problem. Not that that’s easy, of course. Computer scientists are trying to work out how to spot and remove bias in data; others are developing ways to make algorithms better able to explain their decisions. And there are pushes to force companies to be more transparent and accountable about how they use algorithms. It’s a slog, but it is happening. “It’s unrealistic to assume that we’ll ever have a neutral system,” Professor Wachter said. “But with the right systems in place, we can mitigate some of the biases.” With that Apple Card article fresh in your mind, now is a good moment to think about Big Tech’s push into personal finance. Google announced that it was teaming up with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union to offer a “ smart checking ” account next year. Exactly what that will entail is unclear, but Google says it will help bank customers “benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools,” via its Pay app. Also, Facebook unveiled a digital payment system , called Pay, that will let users make payments across its Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. That’s alongside its separate initiative to revolutionize the world of global finance with its own cryptocurrency, Libra. This is all unsurprising. The companies are attracted to the prospect of a new revenue stream. The question is whether or not they can make a go of it. Regulators and lawmakers are already unimpressed. New York State regulators said they would investigate the potentially discriminatory algorithm used by Apple Card. Libra has come under immense criticism from all sides because people don’t trust it . And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, already said of Google’s banking effort to CNBC: “ There ought to be very strict scrutiny .” But there’s another question here: Do people even want to use Big Tech to bank? There’s a lot of inertia in the world of personal finance, and persuading people to switch from their bank to Apple or Google or Facebook will require features with genuine utility, or higher interest rates, or something else stellar. Fear about financial data privacy is probably a concern for consumers, too. In other words, it’s a high bar. News surfaced that a partnership between Google and the hospital provider Ascension could allow the data of the health care company’s patients — 50 million in total — to be uploaded to Google’s cloud-computing platform . Without patients or doctors being notified, some of that data, including names, dates of birth, lab tests and diagnoses, were already being uploaded. Ascension said it was exploring “ machine-learning applications that will have the potential to support improvements in clinical quality” through the deal. Google said it would provide “ tools that Ascension could use to support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety.” This may all be totally O.K. It’s perfectly legal for health care providers to share patients’ medical information with business partners like electronic medical record companies. Still, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services plans to seek more information about whether it complies with the law anyway. Nonetheless, many people found it unnerving. That’s probably because of Google’s motivations: According to The Wall Street Journal , Google hasn’t charged Ascension for the work because it hopes to develop systems based on what it learns. It would eventually sell those systems to other health care providers. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that. But it comes off as a little tone deaf to slurp up data as intimate as health care records without informing patients, at a time when data privacy concerns are more heightened than ever. Apple plans to sell an augmented-reality headset by 2022 and augmented-reality glasses in 2023, according to a report by The Information . Microsoft will honor California’s new privacy law across the United States. It means all of its American users should enjoy the rules, meant to protect consumer data, after Jan. 1. Juul plans to cut $1 billion in costs next year , including the elimination of 650 jobs, as the e-cigarette maker struggles against regulatory and public concern about the risks of vaping. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, drew backlash by calling the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a “mistake” by the Saudi government. He quickly backtracked. Tesla plans to build its first European car factory near Berlin . It will also set up an engineering and design center in the area. Intel fixed a security flaw that it first said had been repaired six months ago, and still hasn’t totally fixed the issue in its chips. Security researchers say the company is misleading users . Disney introduced its Disney Plus streaming services. There were some initial bugs , but the service already has 10 million users. The internet didn’t turn out the way we had hoped.
