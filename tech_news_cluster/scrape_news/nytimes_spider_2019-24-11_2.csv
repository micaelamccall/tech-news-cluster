Cade Metz,"SAN FRANCISCO — Several months ago, Google hired dozens of actors to sit at a table, stand in a hallway and walk down a street while talking into a video camera. Then the company’s researchers, using a new kind of artificial intelligence software, swapped the faces of the actors . People who had been walking were suddenly at a table. The actors who had been in a hallway looked like they were on a street. Men’s faces were put on women’s bodies. Women’s faces were put on men’s bodies. In time, the researchers had created hundreds of so-called deepfake videos. By creating these digitally manipulated videos, Google’s scientists believe they are learning how to spot deepfakes, which researchers and lawmakers worry could become a new, insidious method for spreading disinformation in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. For internet companies like Google, finding the tools to spot deepfakes has gained urgency. If someone wants to spread a fake video far and wide, Google’s YouTube or Facebook’s social media platforms would be great places to do it. Imagine a fake Senator Elizabeth Warren, virtually indistinguishable from the real thing, getting into a fistfight in a doctored video. Or a fake President Trump doing the same. The technology capable of that trickery is edging closer to reality. “Even with current technology, it hard for some people to tell what is real and what is not,” said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor of computer science at Arizona State University who is among the academics partnering with Facebook on its deepfake research. Deepfakes — a term that generally describes videos doctored with cutting-edge artificial intelligence — have already challenged our assumptions about what is real and what is not. In recent months, video evidence was at the center of prominent incidents in Brazil, Gabon in Central Africa and China. Each was colored by the same question: Is the video real? The Gabonese president, for example, was out of the country for medical care and his government released a so-called proof-of-life video. Opponents claimed it had been faked. Experts call that confusion “the liar’s dividend.” “You can already see a material effect that deepfakes have had,” said Nick Dufour, one of the Google engineers overseeing the company’s deepfake research. “They have allowed people to claim that video evidence that would otherwise be very convincing is a fake.” For decades, computer software has allowed people to manipulate photos and videos or create fake images from scratch. But it has been a slow, painstaking process usually reserved for experts trained in the vagaries of software like Adobe Photoshop or After Effects. Now, artificial intelligence technologies are streamlining the process, reducing the cost, time and skill needed to doctor digital images. These A.I. systems learn on their own how to build fake images by analyzing thousands of real images. That means they can handle a portion of the workload that once fell to trained technicians. And that means people can create far more fake stuff than they used to. The technologies used to create deepfakes is still fairly new and the results are often easy to notice. But the technology is evolving. While the tools used to detect these bogus videos are also evolving, some researchers worry that they won’t be able to keep pace. Google recently said that any academic or corporate researcher could download its collection of synthetic videos and use them to build tools for identifying deepfakes. The video collection is essentially a syllabus of digital trickery for computers. By analyzing all of those images, A.I. systems learn how to watch for fakes. Facebook recently did something similar , using actors to build fake videos and then releasing them to outside researchers. Engineers at a Canadian company called Dessa, which specializes in artificial intelligence, recently tested a deepfake detector that was built using Google’s synthetic videos. It could identify the Google videos with almost perfect accuracy. But when they tested their detector on deepfake videos plucked from across the internet, it failed more than 40 percent of the time. They eventually fixed the problem, but only after rebuilding their detector with help from videos found “in the wild,” not created with paid actors — proving that a detector is only as good as the data used to train it. Their tests showed that the fight against deepfakes and other forms of online disinformation will require nearly constant reinvention. Several hundred synthetic videos are not enough to solve the problem, because they don’t necessarily share the characteristics of fake videos being distributed today, much less in the years to come. “Unlike other problems, this one is constantly changing,” said Ragavan Thurairatnam, Dessa’s founder and head of machine learning. In December 2017, someone calling themselves “deepfakes” started using A.I. technologies to graft the heads of celebrities onto nude bodies in pornographic videos . As the practice spread across services like Twitter, Reddit and PornHub, the term deepfake entered the popular lexicon. Soon, it was synonymous with any fake video posted to the internet. The technology has improved at a rate that surprises A.I. experts, and there is little reason to believe it will slow. Deepfakes should benefit from one of the few tech industry axioms that have held up over the years: Computers always get more powerful and there is always more data. That makes the so-called machine-learning software that helps create deepfakes more effective. “It is getting easier, and it will continue to get easier. There is no doubt about it,” said Matthias Niessner, a professor of computer science at the Technical University of Munich who is working with Google on its deepfake research. “That trend will continue for years.” The question is: Which side will improve more quickly? Researchers like Dr. Niessner are working to build systems that can automatically identify and remove deepfakes. This is the other side of the same coin. Like deepfake creators, deepfake detectors learn their skills by analyzing images. Detectors can also improve by leaps and bounds. But that requires a constant stream of new data representing the latest deepfake techniques used around the internet, Dr. Niessner and other researchers said. Collecting and sharing the right data can be difficult. Relevant examples are scarce, and for privacy and copyright reasons, companies cannot always share data with outside researchers. Though activists and artists occasionally release deepfakes as a way of showing how these videos could shift the political discourse online, these techniques are not widely used to spread disinformation. They are mostly used to spread humor or fake pornography, according to Facebook, Google and others who track the progress of deepfakes. Right now, deepfake videos have subtle imperfections that can be readily detected by automated systems, if not by the naked eye. But some researchers argue that the improved technology will be powerful enough to create fake images without these tiny defects. Companies like Google and Facebook hope they will have reliable detectors in place before that happens. “In the short term, detection will be reasonably effective,” said Mr. Kambhampati, the Arizona State professor. “In the longer term, I think it will be impossible to distinguish between the real pictures and the fake pictures.”","Nov. 24, 2019, ",New York Times,NA,Internet Companies Prepare to Fight the ‘Deepfake’ Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/technology/tech-companies-deepfakes.html
Karen Zraick,"Elon Musk on Thursday unveiled the “Cybertruck,” an electric pickup truck that Tesla hopes will rival Ford’s best-selling F-150 line. Its design ensured it would certainly stand out on the road. Looking little like traditional pickup trucks, the Cybertruck has a stainless steel exterior with a triangular roof. But its introduction at an event in Los Angeles didn’t quite go as planned. During a demonstration of the truck’s toughness, its designer lobbed a metal ball at one of its windows, unexpectedly cracking it. He tried again on another window, which also cracked. “Maybe that was a little too hard,” said Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive. He gave the rest of the presentation with the cracked windows behind him. Here are some key questions and takeaways about the rollout. In fact, they are. Ford has said it will release a hybrid F-150 next year, and the company is working on an all-electric version. “With America’s best-selling truck for 42 years, we’ve always focused on serving our truck customers regardless of what others say or do,” Ford said in a statement on Friday. Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, announced at an investor conference on Thursday that the company’s first battery electric pickup truck would go on sale in the fall of 2021. “Electrification is the future,” a G.M. spokesman, Jim Cain, said on Friday. “Our commitment to it is massive, and we intend to help lead that push.” “We’re investing more than $3 billion in a factory in Detroit to build an electric pickup,” he said, adding that the company was planning a “significant investment” in Ohio in a battery cell plant. The start-up Rivian also introduced an electric pickup truck this year. Rivian is considered a potential rival to Tesla, and has gotten a $500 million investment from Ford, as well as backing from Amazon. Rivian’s truck and an electric sport utility vehicle are supposed to go into production next year. The company unveiled three models: a single-motor rear-wheel drive for $39,900, a dual-motor all-wheel drive for $49,900 and a tri-motor all-wheel drive for $69,900. The most expensive truck tows 14,000 pounds and can go up to 500 miles on a single charge, Tesla said. Mr. Musk said the truck had the acceleration of a Porsche. “Trucks have been the same for a very long time,” he said. “Like a hundred years, trucks have been basically the same. We want to try something different.” Orders were immediately available on the Tesla website. Production will begin in late 2021, Tesla said. The demonstrations that led to the cracked windows were meant to prove that the trucks were “really tough, not fake tough,” according to Mr. Musk. Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s chief designer, smacked the door with a sledgehammer, leaving no dent. Mr. Musk said the doors could withstand a bullet from a 9-millimeter handgun. But when Mr. von Holzhausen lobbed a metal ball at the driver’s side window, it immediately cracked. Then when he tried again on the back seat window, it cracked, too. In interviews before the unveiling, Mr. Musk acknowledged that the truck’s look wasn’t exactly conventional. On the “Ride the Lightning” podcast this month, he said the truck would look “pretty sci-fi” and “kind of like a ‘Blade Runner’ truck.” “It’s not going to be for everyone,” he said, with characteristic bravado. “When we unveil this thing, there will be some people who are like, ‘Oh, that doesn’t look like a truck; I don’t want to buy it,’” he said. “It’s like when they came out with automobiles, people were like, ‘Oh, I like a horse and carriage.’ Sure, O.K., you can stick with your horse and carriage, but you’re going to get an automobile later. You just don’t know it.” Mr. Musk argues that electric vehicles will eventually replace traditional ones. And Americans love pickup trucks . But at least in the short term, some analysts are doubtful that traditional truck buyers would invest in early electric models. Karl Brauer, the executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, predicted that the Tesla truck would appeal more to tech enthusiasts than to traditional truck buyers. “Everything from its styling to its drivetrain will be a major departure from standard pickup trucks,” he said in a statement. “As a technology statement for tech-oriented professionals and fans, this truck’s departures from the norm will be seen as assets, not liabilities.” Tesla has become one of the top producers of luxury cars in the United States, rivaling brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz. It is also among the leading companies developing self-driving cars, which have faced tough questions about safety . The company, founded in 2003, has never turned an annual profit. The company sells two sedans and a sport utility vehicle, and has a hatchback coming to market next year. Tesla is also working on a two-seat roadster and a semi truck, both of which it publicly unveiled two years ago. Mr. Musk is a brash Silicon Valley billionaire whose companies and public comments make headlines regularly. This week, for example, a federal judge rejected Mr. Musk’s attempt to throw out a defamation lawsuit brought against him by a British cave explorer whom Mr. Musk had accused of being a “pedo guy.” Mr. Musk is also the chief executive of SpaceX, which launches rockets and spacecraft and has been hired to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA conducted a safety review of SpaceX last year after Mr. Musk smoked pot on the podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience.” Tesla and Mr. Musk had gone through a period of turmoil starting in August 2018, after Mr. Musk abruptly declared on Twitter that he hoped to take the publicly traded company private. The events kicked off furor in the markets and ignited a federal investigation. He was fined $20 million by securities regulators and agreed to relinquish the chairmanship of Tesla for three years. But when he was asked by a Twitter follower about the cost of his tweet, Mr. Musk said it had been “ worth it .” Mr. Musk subsequently announced that he was taking a break from Twitter for a few days, but he eventually returned to the platform.","Nov. 21, 2019",New York Times,NA,Tesla’s Electric ‘Cybertruck’ Is Unveiled.

Sui-Lee Wee,"Models in tight dresses and high heels lounged in a yellow inflatable pool filled with plush toys and vaping equipment. Enthusiastic vapers lined up for free pens and pods, as clouds of mango, mint and rose mingled with the electronic dance music in the air. Attendees of the Shanghai eCig Expo had a lot to celebrate. Vaping has surged in China, drawing money from domestic and Western investors alike. In a country with nearly as many smokers as the entire United States population, the growth potential seemed limitless. “This,” said Frank Wang, an aspiring entrepreneur who wanted to open his own vaping shop, “is where you can make money now.” Perhaps not anymore. China has joined the United States and other governments in putting new pressure on vaping. Regulators have banned online sales of vaping products, and China’s major propaganda outlets have heaped on scrutiny, citing the potential health effects. The government is considering banning vaping in public places. Beijing’s crackdown threatens an almost exclusively Chinese industry that had been counting on the country as a haven. Ninety percent of the world’s e-cigarettes are made in China, and most of them are produced in Shenzhen, a southern city that borders Hong Kong. Some of the nation’s top e-cigarette brands, including RELX, FLOW and Yooz, have taken hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital funding from high-profile names like Sequoia China, IDG Capital and Matrix Partners China . The firms did not respond to requests for comment. The new scrutiny adds to the troubles for Chinese e-cigarette exporters, already hammered by the vaping-related health crisis in the United States that has sickened at least 2,200 people and killed 47. While exporters have long dominated China’s e-cigarette industry, the domestic market took off only about three years ago. Of the 10 million e-cigarette users in China, most are young people who vape sleek, brightly colored devices with flavors like chilled strawberry and orange soda. Euromonitor, the global market research consultancy, said China’s e-cigarette market was worth $750.4 million in 2018, nearly triple the 2014 value. China has more than 300 million smokers, out of a population  of nearly 1.4 billion . In the United States, 10.8 million adults vape . Juul Labs, which is under fire in the United States for marketing its e-cigarettes to teenagers and children, wanted to cash in, too. But  just days after it started business in China, its products were removed from Alibaba and JD.com, two of the biggest e-commerce platforms. Neither the government nor the company gave any explanation. Juul had paid to be at the e- cigarette fair in Shanghai starting in late October but withdrew at the last minute because of the crisis in the United States, according to Li Wangfeng, project director of the expo.  Concerns are mounting about the hazards of vaping among the young, prompting many Chinese to call for regulations. A 2018 tobacco survey commissioned by China’s Center for Disease Control found that people 15 to 24 years old were the most avid vapers, with most buying their devices online. In recent weeks, the state news media has kept up its drumbeat of negative coverage of the industry. On Nov. 4, the most-read article on the website of People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, noted that most e-cigarette companies continued selling their products online despite the ban. The next day, China’s state broadcaster, China Central Television, showed Beijing officials summoning companies to comply with the ban. The day after that, e-cigarettes were no longer available on Alibaba’s Taobao and JD.com, two of China’s most popular e-commerce platforms. For years, the Chinese government allowed the lucrative e-cigarette industry to thrive with no supervision. There was never any consensus on whether e-cigarettes should be classified as tobacco, health or electronics products and which agency should regulate them. Part of the problem, too, is that China’s top tobacco authority is both a regulator and a producer of cigarettes .  In an industry with low barriers to entry, manufacturers took advantage of this void. According to Tianyancha, a corporate database in China, the country has more than 9,500 e-cigarette companies. Many of these brands have haphazard quality controls that have resulted in knockoffs, unsafe ingredients and vape liquid leakage, but the authorities have rarely policed these companies.  In March, CCTV said eight e-cigarette companies made vaping oils with nicotine levels that were higher than what the package stated. Alarmed by these reports, the government is set to force producers to comply with standards on ingredients and manufacturing, according to a draft viewed by The New York Times. Once the “national standard” is enacted, companies would be required to provide details on the number and dosage of ingredients, put warnings on packages and devise ways of testing e-cigarettes to ensure compliance. The process would increase production costs, industry experts say, and is likely to put many small e-cigarette exporters out of business. But Ou Junbiao, head of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Committee of China trade group, said he welcomed the rules because they would give him clear guidelines. He said that previously many companies like his never dared to sell in China for fear of running afoul of the government. “Once the national standard comes out, I can follow its targets and make big investments,” said Mr. Ou, a former factory worker and owner of Sigelei, one of China’s top e-cigarette exporters to the United States, in his office in Shenzhen. “I won’t have to worry that something will happen, but now I don’t know which day the sword would fall.” E-cigarette executives in China were unanimous in attributing the vaping-related illnesses in the United States to the use of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, and vitamin E acetate. The majority of the American victims had vaped THC, but some say only nicotine was involved.  In Shenzhen, several vaping manufacturers have laid off workers, according to two labor recruiters. At the Shanghai expo, Chen Lin, a sales manager for a company that produces parts of e-cigarette atomizers, said his company’s sales fell 80 percent in the past month. “We basically have no orders coming in this month after what happened in the United States,” said Mr. Chen, who attended the expo to look for business partners. Within China, RELX has become the dominant seller of e-cigarettes and controls 44.4 percent of the market for closed vaping systems, e-cigarette pens that come filled, according to data from Euromonitor. It has nearly $286 million in financing, according to its founder, Kate Wang, from major venture capital firms like Sequoia China. Ms. Wang started RELX in 2017, after testing 20 e-cigarettes in the Chinese market and discovering they did not meet her expectations. She said she was motivated to help her two-pack-a-day father quit smoking. Jiang Xingtao, whose title is “director of flavors” at RELX, said that while vaping was safer than smoking tobacco, the jury was still out on whether it is definitively safe. He is collecting data in RELX’s lab in Shenzhen to determine the risks and wants to run clinical trials, singling out the flavoring ingredients. “We can guarantee that they are safe to be consumed through the stomachs, but is it safe enough to be absorbed through the lungs?” Mr. Jiang said. “To be honest, in this respect, neither we nor the industry has evidence that is particularly solid.” Yiwei Wang contributed research.","Nov. 22, 2019",New York Times,NA,China’s Vaping Boom Alarms the Government ,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/business/international/china-vaping-ban.html
Kashmir Hill,"On April 27, a woman in eastern Brooklyn called the police. She told them that just before sunrise, at 5:50 a.m., her ex, John, confronted her on the street with a gun. The two were scheduled to appear at a court hearing over who would get possession of an apartment they once shared. The woman told police that John had said, “Shut the [expletive] up. You better not go to court,” pushed her to the ground and repeatedly punched her legs. The woman already had a protective order in place against John. The next day, the police arrested him and charged him with assault, witness intimidation and other crimes. John told his lawyer, a public defender, that he was innocent. He said that at the time in question, he’d been on his way to work in a different neighborhood in Brooklyn. But he hadn’t arrived there until 6:40 a.m. It was possible that he’d committed the assault and then made his way across the borough. John was scared. Without proof of his whereabouts, he’d be fighting an uphill battle against the state. Innocent people often take plea deals because it’s easier than proving they’re innocent. He thought about losing his home and going to prison. John’s lawyer, Jeffrey Sugarman of the Legal Aid Society of New York City, asked his client a deceptively simple question: Do you have a smartphone? In America, citizens accused of crimes are supposed to have an advantage. The burden of proof is on prosecutors, and the government must turn over all its evidence to defendants, who have no reciprocal obligation. In practice, of course — and especially when defendants don’t have a lot of money — the government has the edge. Investigators can issue subpoenas, compel testimony and pressure defendants into pleas. Today, one way in which the deck is stacked against defendants involves technology. This tech gap has two basic forms. First, law enforcement agencies can use warrants and court orders to compel companies to turn over emails, photos and other communications, but defense lawyers have no such power. And second, the government has access to forensic technology that makes digital investigations easier. Over the last two decades, the machines and software designed to extract data from computers and smartphones were primarily made for and sold to law enforcement. Initially, investigators and prosecutors used such technology mostly to gather evidence about computer crime and child pornography. But now digital forensics can play a role in virtually any case, because the data inside our Facebook accounts, smartphones and devices we wear on our bodies contains so much of our day-to-day movements and communications. To successfully defend its clients, the Legal Aid Society, New York City’s largest public defender office, realized in 2013 that it needed to buy the same tools the police had: forensic devices and software from companies including Cellebrite, Magnet Forensics and Guidance Software. Not only does the expensive technology unearth digital evidence that is otherwise hard or impossible to find, it captures it in a format that can hold up in court, as opposed to evidence that could have been tampered with or forged. A properly processed device can yield emails, text messages, call logs, location history, photos, metadata and more — even material that has been deleted. The Legal Aid Society’s New York forensic lab is a rarity in the world of public defenders, because most tightly budgeted offices simply can’t afford it. The bill for the equipment was approximately $100,000 — a fortune in a public defender’s budget, but a small amount by the standards of the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which in 2016 built a forensics lab for $10 million . On a Wednesday in May, John — whose lawyer asked that his last name be withheld — went to the Legal Aid Society ’s TriBeCa office, stuck between Gap’s headquarters and a preschool. He handed his Android phone to one of the organization’s six forensic analysts,  Brandon Reim . Mr. Reim wanted to reconstruct John’s movements on the morning of April 27 . He plugged the phone into a hand-held tablet, called the Touch2 , made by the Israeli company Cellebrite. Known as a universal forensic extraction device, the Touch2 is able to pull data from almost any gadget and preserve it in a format that courts will accept as evidence. Mr. Reim also used a Cellebrite software program called Cloud Analyzer to reach John’s data on Google’s servers. After a few hours, Mr. Reim found what he was looking for: Google had logged more than 100 location points, with latitude and longitude, for John’s phone during the period when he had supposedly threatened his ex. A spokesman for Cellebrite, Christopher Bacey , said the company does not disclose its prices. But government budgets offer up some transparency. The Touch2 can cost $10,500 with a $3,100 annual maintenance fee, while Cloud Analyzer can go for $7,999 , with an annual fee of $2,625. At the Legal Aid Society, Mr. Reim and his fellow analysts are searching for data to support clients’ claims of innocence. But if the data instead implicates the client, that’s valuable, too — it helps public defenders understand the strengths or weaknesses of their cases and decide whether to negotiate a plea. Google’s minute-by-minute accounting of John’s whereabouts, which might seem dystopian in a different context, proved beneficial because it confirmed his story. He left his house at 5:10 a.m. to take the subway to work. At the time of the supposed assault in eastern Brooklyn, he was five miles away. Mr. Reim plotted John’s movements on a Google map. Mr. Sugarman showed it to the assistant district attorney, who quickly dismissed the case. As forensic technology has advanced, many constituencies beyond law enforcement have come to enjoy its power — the armed services, intelligence agencies, even corporate investigative outfits. Public defenders and citizens accused of crimes remain an afterthought. When I sent an inquiry to Cellebrite about how its products “get used by the defense instead of by law enforcement,” its spokesman assumed I was talking about the military. There are dozens of forensic devices on the market. The Department of Homeland Security has tested many of them to report how well they do what they claim. Cellebrite, which has promoted its ability to break into locked phones , is one of the industry’s biggest names. Grayshift , founded by a former Apple engineer, makes a product called GrayKey that has allowed law enforcement agencies to break into and extract data even from encrypted iPhones . There’s also Magnet Forensics, which has offices in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands and Singapore; Black Swan Digital Forensics, based in Memphis, which advertises a “remote extraction” service for around $500 a pop; and OpenText, which recently acquired the California-based Guidance Software, which was one of the first to start making forensic software, back in 2002. Though public defenders aren’t their typical customers, most forensics companies are willing to sell to them. Not Grayshift. A public defender who contacted the company this year with a sales inquiry was told that Grayshift “is tightly controlling the sales and distribution to local, state, and federal government law enforcement end-users only.” ( The company did not respond to a request for comment. ) At least public defenders know that GrayKey exists. For years, that wasn’t the case with so-called I.M.S.I. catchers (for international mobile subscriber identity), better known as StingRays. These devices, made by the Harris Corporation, impersonate cell towers to intercept texts, calls, emails and other data; they can also locate cellphones and thus the people using them. Harris has require d law enforcement agencies to sign nondisclosure agreements when they buy the devices, and for years, police and prosecutors hid their existence from defense attorneys. The secret wasn’t exposed until one tech-savvy California tax defrauder became obsessed with finding out how the police had found him . Forensics experts have helped law enforcement acquire even the most daunting digital evidence. After a December 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., the F.B.I. asked Apple to help it get into a locked iPhone. Apple refused, on the grounds that it would undermine the security of their products. The F.B.I. ended up paying an unnamed third party to break into the device. “It’s definitely an uneven playing field,” said Jennifer Mnookin, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Law enforcement has an understandable desire to extricate data from the digital world to solve cases, but there hasn’t been adequate scrutiny of these new techniques.” Ms. Mnookin described a recurring pattern: Law enforcement agencies get a new investigative technique — fingerprinting, DNA analysis, breathalyzer tests — and those representing the accused struggle to play catch-up. Developing the new technical expertise necessary to adequately defend their clients is a challenge. Not only do public defenders tend to be underfunded, law enforcement can monopolize the experts in the field and forbid them from working for the defense. Jim Kouril , a forensic analyst who worked as a police officer in Idaho for 24 years before joining the public defender’s office, said his former colleagues viewed his career move as going to work “for the dark side.” But his new position was hardly glamorous. “ The big discrepancy between law enforcement and public defense is resources,” Mr. Kouril said. “I had everything I wanted in law enforcement: high-powered computers and equipment. Now, it’s like pulling teeth.” In a review of public defender offices across the country, The New York Times found no other organization with a forensics operation comparable to the one in Manhattan. A handful of offices — in Pima County, Ariz.; Cook County, Ill.; and Canyon County, Idaho — recently bought one extraction device or have an internal expert. The public defender’s office in Philadelphia has started building a dedicated lab. But most public defenders have to hire private consultants to conduct forensic examinations of the evidence in their cases. This is a costly exercise that requires people to give up their phones for at least a week — an impossible request in some cases, particularly when it’s a third party involved in a case and not the defendant. Otherwise, public defenders can get this digital evidence only if law enforcement chooses to examine a device. (Most agencies have no trouble getting access to the technology. A police force or prosecutor’s office that lacks internal resources can reach out to the nearly 350 shared cybercrime labs across the country for help.) If a case goes to trial — a vanishingly rare occurrence, as the vast majority of defendants in federal and state cases alike take plea bargains — a public defender might get a forensic report turned over. But these reports can be thousands of pages long, easily navigable only if you have a forensic company’s proprietary software. Jerome Greco, a New York public defender who came to specialize in technological evidence partly because of an interest in hacking as a teenager in New Jersey, runs the Legal Aid Society’s forensic lab. He says the unit has proved invaluable in the early weeks of new cases, preventing clients from being formally charged or getting them out of jail when digital evidence makes their innocence clear. “Americans spend so much more time on their phones now. And the amount of information and value of digital information has dramatically increased as a result,” said Mr. Greco. “Law enforcement is onto that. But so are we.” He added, “Our goal is to push back against law enforcement’s technological advantage.” Geoff Burkhart, who oversees the public defender system in Texas, said that his colleagues barely have case-management software, let alone forensic equipment, and that the budget to hire outside forensic experts is minimal. “All the tough-on-crime years, all the funding went into prosecution and policing, while funding for public defense stayed stagnant,” said Mr. Burkhart. “So public defenders’ caseloads went up, but their funding didn’t.” Public defenders are also at a disadvantage to prosecutors when it comes to interacting with big tech companies. A 1986 law, the Stored Communications Act, requires that law enforcement agencies obtain a warrant to get access to emails, private messages and other data kept on companies’ servers. Public defenders are held to the same standard, even though they can’t get warrants; they can only issue subpoenas, which limit them to asking for information about users, not the content of their digital activity. Facebook and Google “are terrible to work with,” said Joel Simberg , a public defender in Cook County. “The state’s attorney and police get great information, but we get turned down all the time. They tell us we need to get a warrant. We can’t get warrants. We have subpoenas, and often they ignore them.” Facebook , Google and Twitter have special online portals for law enforcement agencies, which make it easier for them to request information from users’ accounts. But there are no equivalent portals for public defenders. When Mr. Greco, in New York, wants to send a subpoena to Facebook, he has to get a judge to sign off on it in California and hire a server to deliver it in person to the company’s office in Menlo Park. “They make it supereasy for law enforcement and superhard for everyone else,” said Mr. Greco. “They should make portals for public defenders.” “People expect us to keep their information private, and we believe strongly that federal law requires us to do so,” said a Facebook spokeswoman , Rochelle Nadhiri , by email. “That’s why we have strict guidelines for sharing information in response to requests for their information.” In a forthcoming article for the U.C.L.A. Law Review, Rebecca Wexler , an assistant professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, argues that “exceptions to privacy laws that enable law enforcement to access sensitive information should also apply to criminal defense investigators.” Ms. Wexler cites the case of Lee Sullivan and Derrick Hunter, two California men accused of murder. “Sullivan tried to subpoena Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for private messages that would show that the sole witness who placed him at the scene was lying, but the companies refused to comply, arguing that a federal privacy law from 1986 prevented it,” Ms. Wexler writes. “That left Sullivan and co-defendant Derrick Hunter in jail six years awaiting trial without key evidence to test the credibility of the witnesses against them.” A judge ordered the companies to hand over the data earlier this year, but they resisted; he held them in contempt in July. “Facebook and Twitter have made it clear that they are unwilling to alter their behavior, regardless of the harm to others — or the rulings of this court,” the judge, Charles Crompton, wrote. Giovanna Falbo , a spokeswoman for Twitter, said, “We have taken a stand against the state court’s order in this case because we believe that it violates the federal Stored Communications Act and undermines a key purpose of that law — to protect individuals’ privacy rights in electronic communications.” Al Gidari, the director of privacy at Stanford Law School, said that the Stored Communications Act prevents defense lawyers from using subpoenas to harass witnesses, victims or police officers by obtaining their personal information. He has long pushed for a federal rule change that would allow judges to force prosecutors to write warrants on behalf of defense lawyers who have proved certain evidence is vital to collect. Jeffrey D. Stein , a public defender in Washington, D.C., recently wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Post on the subject of exculpatory evidence remaining trapped online. “Innocent people will continue to be vulnerable to conviction, not because evidence of their innocence doesn’t exist, but because the law doesn’t permit them to reach it,” he argued. “Funding is always the obstacle, [but] this should be mainstream across the country,” said Tina Luongo, the lawyer who founded the Legal Aid Society of New York City’s forensic lab. “It’s the clients’ constitutional right. It exonerates our clients and helps us bring them justice.” Aaron Krolik contributed reporting.","Nov. 22, 2019",New York Times,NA,Imagine Being on Trial.

Jamie Condliffe,"Each week, we review the week’s news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Hi, I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. For one last time before I leave The New York Times, here’s a look at the week’s tech news: The story usually goes like this: Automation is going to take our jobs. But the reality is far more nuanced, and debate rages about which jobs will be automated, at what scale and where. For the most part, one thing is agreed on: Blue-collar workers who perform repetitive work are most exposed. That might not be quite right, though. A study published by the Brookings Institution on Wednesday looks at the degree to which professions are exposed to A.I. by comparing job descriptions with patent descriptions of new A.I. technologies, a method developed by the Stanford researcher Michael Webb. It found that A.I. will be “a significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors and analysts,” including those in relatively technical roles. Perhaps the most surprising finding: Holders of bachelor’s degrees would be exposed to A.I. over five times more than workers with only a high school degree. “Lots of math, science, technology and business roles involve, say, operating a power plant to maximize energy efficiency, or running an ad campaign to minimize cost per click,” explained Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings and one of the study’s authors. “And these are exactly the things that A.I. is best at.” Previously, similar studies lumped together robotics and A.I. But when they are picked apart, it makes sense that A.I. — which is about planning, perceiving and so on — would hit white-collar roles. Still, workers needn’t panic. Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in technology and employment, said A.I. was “more likely to complement people in those jobs rather than replacing them.” And Mr. Muro points out that “these workers are frequently the ones that companies have already invested in” and are likely to have been consulted about their futures. Mr. Muro added: “I for one am a bit less concerned about the white-collar folks than the less educated ones stuck in dead-end service work or the gig economy.” I recently explained how TikTok is in trouble because the red-hot video app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is under scrutiny from lawmakers in the United States. At the heart of this is a big, untested argument that Chinese laws could force TikTok, in theory, to send data to the Chinese government. In an interview with The Times, TikTok’s chief executive, Alex Zhu, tried to assuage Washington’s fears : No, TikTok does not censor videos that displease China, he said. And no, it does not share user data with China, or even with its Beijing-based parent company. Mr. Zhu said he’d personally reject an appeal for data even if it came from President Xi Jinping. And it’s reportedly trying other stuff, too. The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok executives had discussed “rebranding it in the United States” and “expanding operations in Southeast Asia, possibly Singapore — which would allow executives to distance the video-sharing app from China.” But it’s unclear how far such assurances can go. “There doesn’t seem to be a way to assuage regulators in the U.S. without removing that ownership issue,” Adam Segal, the director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me. In the Times interview, Mr. Zhu said a sale of TikTok’s American operations hadn’t been discussed. But he didn’t rule out the possibility of ByteDance’s reorganizing it as a separate company with a new board. It might not have much choice. Iran has demonstrated that it’s willing to take its citizens offline — and, perhaps more worryingly, that it’s able to do so without plunging domestic infrastructure into chaos. The Iranian government recently imposed an almost complete nationwide internet blackout that lasted for almost five days . It came after protests erupted across the country after the government said it would raise gasoline prices . Amnesty International estimated that as many as 106 people were killed. Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, explained to me in an email that the Iranian government was trying to limit the spread of evidence of state violence. “The deaths and the ruthless images of authorities raining bullets on protesters that are being disseminated are not the images they want dominating their narrative,” she said. Blocking internet traffic and, by extension, social media certainly cuts information flows. But there’s little evidence that internet blackouts undermine protests. A 2018 report by Human Rights Watch found “no substantive data or evidence to prove that internet shutdowns can scale down violence.” That Iran’s blackout persisted, Ms. Alimardani said, was a strong indication that it had done little to calm the protests. But the shutdown revealed one success for Iran’s government: its National Information Network, a domestic, highly censored digital infrastructure. That infrastructure enabled the nation’s critical services, such as finance and health care, to largely operate normally, demonstrating that the country is well equipped to shut down the public internet. “They are proving they can and will cut people off if they question authorities again,” Ms. Alimardani said. “Don’t be evil,” it once said. But Google’s internal mantra now looks like it could be more like: “Don’t question the management.” It has come to light that Google has ended its biweekly all-hands meetings . The decision was made just days after Google employees protested the interrogation of two colleagues by the company’s investigations team, according to CNBC. And it all comes on the back of a staff protest last year over the company’s handling of sexual harassment complaints, vibrant discussions on internal memo boards about company policies and pushback from some workers about Google’s work in China and with the United States military. Then, this past week, it transpired that Google had hired an anti-union consulting firm to advise its management as it deals with worker unrest. It’s still too early to tell how this will shake out at Google. But what’s clear is that the company’s traditional embrace of transparency and flexibility for workers is straining as more employees question its motives and actions. What caused Uber’s autonomous car crash in 2018? The main reason, according to the National Transportation Safety Board, was the safety driver’s failure to monitor the road . President Trump visited a Texas factory that builds Apple computers and made a series of inaccurate comments . Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, didn’t correct him — perhaps thinking that it might make it harder for the company to get a tariff waiver? The Commerce Department extended Huawei’s reprieve so that it can still buy goods from American companies for another 90 days , and approved “ several ” individual licenses for American companies to do business with Huawei, while it remains on a trade blacklist. The Federal Trade Commission said it was pursuing “multiple” antitrust investigations into major digital platforms alongside its inquiry into Facebook. Expect Europe to get even tougher on Big Tech.

Julia Jacobs,"By  Julia Jacobs Photographers have learned to be inventive in evading Instagram’s ban on female nipples. They’ve used paint, glitter, hair and flower petals to obscure them. They’ve covered them up with leaves, cornstarch, a spatula, handbags, shot glasses, strands of bubble gum, and sand. Some have inserted a rectangular black censorship bar. Others have used digital editing tools to blur the nipples or overlay a patch of the model’s skin color to give the impression that she has no nipples at all. These artistic gymnastics are the result of Instagram’s community guidelines , which allow female nipples in paintings and sculptures, but not typically in photography. And they are related to a campaign — #Freethenipple — being waged by artists, activists and celebrities, and playing out on the social media platform itself. These Instagrammers are pushing the boundaries with doctored photographs, as well as posting unadulterated photos that test how far the platform is willing to go in censoring their artwork. It’s a cat-and-mouse game that the cat usually wins, since the cat has access to artificial intelligence and 15,000 people working around the world to review posts and look for banned material. “Censoring photography is invalidating it as an art form,” said Joanne Leah, a Brooklyn-based photographer who estimates that she has about one post removed every month. “Every time something gets censored, it feels like a punch in the gut.” Since Instagram’s ascent as a mainstream, image-centric social media platform, it has effectively turned its users into published photographers. It has also allowed artists, once at the mercy of galleries, to promote their work independently, as long as they abide by certain rules. There are plenty of risqué images allowed on the site.  Photos of women  in sheer tops — the shape of their nipples exposed — often stay up, as do some with the nipples craftily covered or altered . But bare nipples on a photograph of a woman are off limits, though Instagram says it makes allowances for users who make clear that the display of nudity is meant as a form of protest or to raise awareness for a cause. That’s why photos of mastectomy scarring and breastfeeding are allowed. ( Instagram started allowing photos and videos of breastfeeding in 2014 after pressure from activists.) The same rules apply on Facebook, which owns Instagram. In defending its policies, the company emphasizes its vast global reach : 2.4 billion monthly users on Facebook, and over 1 billion on Instagram, both in 100 languages. In an email, Instagram’s head of public policy, Karina Newton, said that the site isn’t trying to “impose its own value judgment on how nipples should be viewed in society.” “We’re trying to reflect the sensitivities of the broad and diverse array of cultures and countries across the world in our policies,” Newton said. Instagram’s rationale for drawing a line between photography and other forms of fine art is that the nipples typically belong to living people, and the site cannot know for sure whether the subjects have given consent . Posting a photo of a marble Aphrodite doesn’t present the same problem for them. Pictures of genitals and “close-ups of fully nude buttocks” are also against the rules, but it’s the explicit exclusion of the female nipple that has drawn the fiercest objections. Rihanna , Miley Cyrus and Chrissy Teigen , who have tens of millions of followers each, have tested the Instagram censors by exposing their nipples in posts that were swiftly taken down by Instagram. But at the forefront of the movement have been artists who have put persistent pressure on Instagram to loosen its restrictions in a way, some of them acknowledge , that would run afoul of social custom. Free the Nipple has been a cause for years, and the hashtag on Instagram now aggregates more than four million posts. Leah, 41, has been communicating directly with representatives from Facebook for about a year and a half about her concerns over how their policy affects artists like her. So the company decided it was time for a meeting. Last month it hosted about two dozen artists and anticensorship activists at its offices in Lower Manhattan  for a five-hour discussion with the company about Instagram’s policing of nudity in their work. The company representatives listened, but gave no signs of budging, according to several people who attended. The company told them that it was just keeping within the bounds of social propriety: If you walked down the street in New York, one employee explained, you wouldn’t see exposed female nipples on advertisements. One of those who attended, Micol Hebron, 47, an interdisciplinary artist in Los Angeles (Instagram paid for her travel), snapped a topless selfie outside the building and tried to post it after the meeting. Almost immediately, her Instagram account was shut down. Several years ago, after Facebook took down a topless photo of Hebron from  an art exhibition about breast cancer awareness, she created what she calls a  male nipple pasty — a circular cutout of a man’s nipple that a woman can copy and can stick on her own nipples. As Hebron’s pasty cleverly pointed out, Instagram’s ban does not extend to male nipples. In the real world, the female breast has had some success on the equal-rights front. In February, a federal appeals court in Denver decided against Fort Collins, Colo., which sought to uphold an ordinance banning women from going topless in public. In New York, a 1992 State Court of Appeals decision established women’s right to go topless in public for noncommercial reasons. But decisions elsewhere have let similar laws stay on the books because, unlike male chests, female chests were considered to be an “erogenous zone.” When it comes to nipples, there are “criteria” to help both human and technological reviewers identify a nipple as male or female, Instagram’s Newton said. The criteria include indicators of the person’s gender, an Instagram spokeswoman said. But Instagram stresses that the system is imperfect. “There are times that we can’t tell — and mistakes may be made,” Newton said. In July, Instagram introduced the option for users to appeal deleted content; before, users could appeal if their account had been deleted but not in response to individual posts having been removed. As the great democratizer of photography, Instagram has opened up a new chapter of art history. From depictions of the nursing Madonna in 14th-century Italy to Frenchwomen lounging in the nude in 16th-century paintings, bare breasts have long been an artistic preoccupation, the gender studies scholar Marilyn Yalom wrote in the 1997 book “A History of the Breast.” “Though breasts still carry an overload of cultural and sexual expectations, many women hope to see the day when their chests do not have to bear such a burden,” Yalom wrote. What is different about the current era of nude art is that women are often the ones wielding the camera or the paintbrush. Mona Kuhn , 49, a Brazilian-born photographer, whose work focuses on the human form and often captures nude figures , has had work exhibited at the Louvre and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. But on Instagram, she said, she has to hold back what she considers some of her most important pieces. “I cannot promote my work as much as some other person who does landscapes,” she said. Other artists have accepted the reality that they don’t have free rein on such a wildly popular, global platform. “No one forced us to use Instagram,” said John Yuyi , 28, who uses her own body, with nipples obscured , to make popular Instagram posts about human interaction with technology. “They can say, ‘if you don’t like our rules, you can find another social media.’” At Facebook’s meeting, some artists pressed the tech employees on the matter of transgender and nonbinary users posting topless images. Is it still a female nipple if the person no longer considers themselves female? What if their nipples used to be anatomically male, but they transitioned to being a woman? Last year, Rain Dove, a gender-nonconforming model with more than 360,000 Instagram followers, found themselves in a battle with the platform’s censors when they posted topless images with breasts exposed. In one video, they were playing basketball . In another, they were drinking from a gallon of milk, wearing only boxer briefs. Dove , 30, said in an interview that after Instagram took down two of the topless posts, they would repeatedly republish them, writing in the caption that because Dove did not consider themselves female, their nipples weren’t female either. In the caption’s text, Dove threatened to take legal action if Instagram continued to remove their posts, and eventually, the bare-chested images were allowed to stay. “No one’s head exploded,” Dove said. “We’re all going to be fine!” Newton said that if Instagram’s content reviewers have context signaling that a user identifies as a man or nonbinary (for example, if the user states their pronouns), nipple exposure is allowed. And if a transgender woman posts an image of their exposed nipples, Instagram will remove it. But Instagram is not showing any signs of relaxing its general ban on female nipples . So artists have begun to factor that into their work, even as #freethenipple lives on. Amanda Charchian , a commercial and artistic photographer who shoots nudes, often obscures women’s nipples with pinpoints of color or a blurring feature. Charchian, 31, is now working on a series that involves her applying paint to photographs of nude women and architecture, and she said that she feels Instagram’s restrictions creeping into her artistic process. “When there’s a nipple, I think to myself, ‘Should I cover it or not?’” she said. “That’s the infiltration of Instagram censorship on my mind and my creative decision-making.”","Nov. 22, 2019",New York Times,NA,Will Instagram Ever ‘Free the Nipple’?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/design/instagram-free-the-nipple.html
David McCabe,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Friday to bar cellular carriers from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from Huawei and ZTE, two Chinese companies, saying the companies endangered national security. The rules put new restrictions on money earmarked for expanding broadband to underserved areas of the country, including rural areas, where building internet infrastructure can be prohibitively expensive without government support. The agency’s five commissioners unanimously approved the proposal. They said the move was vital as American wireless carriers rolled out the next generation of wireless technology, known as 5G. The new restrictions could eventually cover additional companies. “In taking these steps, we demonstrate the F.C.C.’s commitment to doing everything we can to address national security threats to our communications networks,” said Ajit Pai, the agency’s chairman. Huawei has denied that it would enable Chinese government spying and criticized the F.C.C.’s decision. “These unwarranted actions will have profound negative effects on connectivity for Americans in rural and underserved areas across the United States,” Huawei said in a statement. The company added that it believed the F.C.C. order was “unlawful” and based on a faulty understanding of Chinese law. The vote was the latest action in Washington to limit Huawei’s ability to operate in the United States. The Commerce Department has placed Huawei on a list of companies that American firms cannot sell to, and policymakers have tried to stop federal agencies from buying its products. The restrictions have pleased Huawei’s critics. But they worry rural telecommunications providers , who say the Chinese equipment is more affordable than similar products from competitors. The debate at the F.C.C. now moves to a new front: the Huawei and ZTE equipment already installed around the country. The rural providers have pushed for money to reimburse them should they be required to replace the equipment. The arguments over Huawei have been heightened by President Trump’s apparent willingness to use the firm as a bargaining chip in his trade war with China, worrying critics who say trade talks should not be tied to national security questions. On Monday, the Commerce Department said it would extend a temporary license that allows American companies to continue working with Huawei, despite the export restrictions linked to its presence on the so-called “entity list.” Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said later in the week that it had begun to issue licenses to specific American firms to allow them to circumvent the restrictions as well. On Thursday, a group of senators from both parties called on Mr. Trump to stop issuing those licenses. The group, which includes Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said the licenses would “allow Huawei to fully resume its engagement with certain U.S. firms without an adequate assessment of the risks to national security.”","Nov. 22, 2019",New York Times,NA,Huawei Funds Are Cut Off by F.C.C.

Niraj Chokshi,"Well, you had your chance. After going up for auction last month , Democracy.com has officially been sold. Its new owner is Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks. Mr. Cuban, who is also famous for his role on the reality television show “Shark Tank,” confirmed the sale in an email exchange with The New York Times. He explained that he had no plans for the highly symbolic address and had purchased the domain to protect it from abuse — or, in his words, “to make sure someone didn’t do something crazy with it.” He offered limited additional information about the deal. “Someone sent me a cold email,” he explained. “I gave them a price I would be willing to pay. They said yes.” He declined to say how much he had paid. The minimum bid had been set at $300,000, but the auction was called off after Mr. Cuban made his offer. The sale, through Heritage Auctions, had been orchestrated by Talmage Cooley , an entrepreneur who used the domain for years as the home to a start-up social platform where politicians and civic groups could connect with supporters. The enterprise ran out of money in February, prompting the decision to sell the domain, which was owned by one of Mr. Cooley’s investors, whom he declined to identify. Days before the auction was set to close, Mr. Cooley emailed Mr. Cuban to invite him to buy the domain. “I just made it super succinct and talked about the importance of this name being used for good,” Mr. Cooley said. Mr. Cuban replied within minutes and the sale was completed within a few days, according to Mr. Cooley. (While he declined to share further details about the deal, citing a confidentiality agreement, Mr. Cooley said that Mr. Cuban’s offer exceeded the auction’s minimum bid.) Mr. Cuban has long been vocal about politics. In 2016, he endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and he has described himself as a social centrist and fiscal conservative. In September, he said that his family opposed the idea of his running for president in 2020, but that if he did, he would do so as an independent. Despite its resonant and memorable name, Democracy.com has had a relatively unremarkable history. It was registered in the mid-1990s on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, which ultimately did nothing with it, according to a 1997 article in the magazine In These Times. The domain was later sold to John Carrieri , an entrepreneur who told The Times last month that he had wanted to use it as the home to an educational website but sold it about a decade later after deciding that he couldn’t garner the resources necessary to do it justice. The domain was then listed in auctions hosted by a domain name reseller in 2010 and 2012, the year that Mr. Cooley said he began licensing the address. While he is disappointed that the start-up didn’t work out, Mr. Cooley said he was happy that the domain was in good hands. “I’m glad that somebody in the U.S. bought it, as opposed to a Russian counter-democracy organization,” he said.","Nov. 22, 2019",New York Times,NA,Democracy.com Has a New Owner.
