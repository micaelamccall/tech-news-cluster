Peter Holley,"On the muggy streets of suburban Houston, amid McMansions, bright green lawns and stately oak trees, a futuristic race is quietly afoot. The contestants are not people but late-model Toyota Priuses outfitted with an array of sophisticated sensors. Despite fierce competition and unending pressure to perform, the nearly silent electric vehicles do not speed. They move cautiously, rigorously following traffic laws and never topping 25 mph. Their goal is not an easily discerned finish line but to map large swaths of the nation’s fourth-largest metropolis, a sprawling patchwork of neighborhoods, mini-cities, strip malls, gridlocked superhighways and mazelike gated communities — an area so prodigious in size it easily could swallow Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island whole. The vehicles are owned by Nuro , a Silicon Valley robotics company with an ambitious goal — to become the world’s preeminent autonomous delivery service, allowing millions of people to have groceries and other goods delivered by robots instead of making trips to the store, potentially reducing traffic and kicking off a new chapter in our relationship with machines. For months now, Nuro’s robotically piloted vehicles have been successfully, if quietly, delivering groceries to restaurants and homes around Houston, the vehicles’ sensors mapping the city as they go. The faster Nuro’s vehicles map Houston’s notoriously chaotic roadways, the faster the company can refine its software and export its business model elsewhere. But time is in short supply. Like Nuro, companies such as Amazon, Alphabet-owned Waymo, Robomart, General Motors’ Cruise division, Ford-affiliated Argo AI, Starship Technologies and many others are also rushing to deploy high-functioning autonomous vehicles for delivery and passenger transport, with some companies attracting major deals and billions in funding. Their goal is to earn public trust and offer real-life convenience, experts say, heightening their chances of securing a valuable foothold in a new era defined by autonomous transportation. To get there, they will first have to run their autonomous vehicles, or AVs, through millions of miles of driving tests in cities such as Houston until they are glitch-free and unquestionably safe. “The pressure is real,” said David Syverud, head of robot operations at Nuro. “And to be clear, it is a race in the AV space to deploy quickly and be the first to really get there.” Silicon Valley pioneered self-driving cars. But some of its tech-savvy residents don’t want them tested in their neighborhoods. As with any race, more speed engenders greater risk, particularly in Houston, a car-dependent city dominated by construction, impatient drivers and the kind of busy roadways that present a serious challenge to experienced human drivers, much less robotic ones. Each year, more than 600 people die on Houston-area roads, making the city one of the nation’s deadliest major metro areas for drivers, according to a comprehensive analysis of regional traffic fatalities , using 16 years of federal data, that was recently published by the Houston Chronicle. Regardless of the risks, AV enthusiasts like Syverud are confident that there will come a day in the not-so-distant future when — almost no matter where your family resides — your groceries will be delivered to your home via an autonomous robot. But to make that vision a reality, companies like Nuro have to build it from scratch, a herculean effort involving dozens of vehicle operators and hundreds of engineers working in synchronicity each day to test robotic systems and map entire cities. After completing a successful pilot in the Phoenix area, Nuro, which has raised more than $1 billion in funding, arrived in Houston last year and launched autonomous deliveries for Kroger , the nation’s largest operator of traditional supermarkets, in April and began working with Domino’s Pizza in June. The city’s reliance on cars has done little to burnish its national reputation, but it was a boon for Nuro. With an average commute of about 60 minutes round-trip , hungry Houstonians are eager to avoid driving any more than they have to, Nuro officials say. Company officials say they were also drawn to Houston for the complexity of its metropolitan environment, a puzzle of independent communities, each with its own road conditions, zoning ordinances, parking rules and traffic laws. Some area neighborhoods offer wide lanes and little traffic, others are narrow and perpetually hectic — providing the company’s robotic software a massive variety of testing conditions. Amazon Scouts have started delivering packages in Southern California As the country’s most ethnically diverse large city — and with a foreign-born population of 1.4 million — Houston also is a place where Nuro officials could probe fundamental questions about its business model. “The big question for us is: Who is going to use this service, and how often will they do it?” said Sola Lawal, a Nuro product operations manager based in Houston who formerly worked for Uber. “Our robots don’t care who they’re delivering to, but we want to understand how different demographics interact with and feel about the robots. Houston allows for this broad swath of experience in one city.” Delivering items locally to a customer’s door — particularly food that has to stay hot or cold — has long been one of the most expensive logistical problems in transportation, in part because of the labor costs. It is far cheaper to transport hundreds of packages in the back of a UPS truck with multiple drop-offs at addresses along a set route. That has helped hinder the online spread of grocery delivery, which can be cost-prohibitive when factoring in a driver’s wages. Nuro appears to have found a way around that complication. Using the maps created by its current vehicles, Nuro plans to launch in the coming months a new version of its fully autonomous, passenger-less vehicle known as the R2. The company claims that a smaller delivery vehicle, such as the cooler-size delivery robots employed by Amazon or Starship Technologies, would be unable to travel at the speeds and distances necessary to make autonomous grocery delivery efficient in Houston. A new autonomous delivery vehicle is designed to operate like a bicycle A larger vehicle without a human driver offers other benefits as well, according to Nuro — more space for groceries, better maneuverability and braking, no need for interior safety features to accommodate people, and less danger to people if the vehicle is involved in an accident. Regardless of what robot does the job, for Yael Cosset, the chief digital officer for Kroger, a partner to Nuro’s test in Houston, there is little choice but to embrace autonomous delivery. “A few years ago, we were telling customers that if they place an order today we can have it ready for them tomorrow afternoon, and that was okay with them,” Cosset said. “Today, some of our customers will expect that same order to be available within the hour. “Now, if you need a roasted chicken and pizza and a bottle of milk in the next 45 minutes, I can fulfill that demand for the customer because of Nuro, which is a critical component of our delivery modalities,” he added. When a robotically driven vehicle pulls up to a home with groceries, two Nuro employees — known as vehicle operators — are always inside. (That is likely to change when Nuro launches its fully autonomous R2 vehicle in Houston later this year.) Each day in Houston, all 65 of Nuro’s vehicle operators, working in teams that consist of a driver and a co-driver, are tasked with preparing Nuro’s fleet for the road. Already, the company says, drivers are making dozens of deliveries a day, many of them, somewhat surprisingly, to businesses in Houston’s bustling restaurant scene. In Arizona, a robot-driven car will deliver groceries to your home Like driving instructors overseeing an artificially intelligent teenager behind the wheel, operators — who remain ready to wrest control of the car from the robot if something goes wrong — monitor and document turns, braking and acceleration as the vehicles, outfitted with dozens of navigational sensors, quietly roll from one street to the next, creating a hyper-detailed map of the city. Though their job may sound uneventful, vehicle operators say they must remain in a state of near-constant focus for hours at a time — punctuated by brief moments of extreme intensity. As the vehicle moves, the co-driver, who has a laptop that monitors the robotic system, verbally informs the driver of the robot’s intentions before they occur — a cue known as a “call-out.” The driver’s job is to listen to the call-outs and ensure the vehicle is behaving appropriately while monitoring the driving conditions outside the car. There is no eating in the car, and drinks must be sealed. To keep things fresh, drivers and co-drivers switch places every few hours and take periodic breaks. Narrow streets, potholes, construction and low-hanging tree branches are obstacles that offer the team a chance to improve the vehicles’ neural network, in hopes of bringing full autonomy to life. But the biggest obstacle is a human one — an aggressive driver in another vehicle, frustrated by the robot’s slow-moving, law-abiding style. “What keeps me up at night is a member of my team being injured by a human driver who is drunk or distracted,” Syverud said. Domino’s will start delivering pizzas via an autonomous robot this fall Many of the company’s vehicle operators, such as Troy Veuleman, have no background in tech and found their roles through online job postings. Working as an emergency medical technician in Shreveport, La., for four years, Veuleman grew accustomed to long, stress-filled hours behind the wheel of an ambulance, often with little downtime between shifts. Whether he was racing through rush-hour traffic with a patient in critical condition aboard or keeping a gunshot victim calm when the person’s life depended on it, Veuleman said he honed the art of remaining clearheaded and decisive amid a daily stream of heart-pounding drama. When he decided to switch careers last year, those same skills — as well as an exceptionally clean driving record — made the 25-year-old an attractive candidate for sitting behind the wheel of a robotically driven car and remaining alert for hours on end. To prepare vehicle operators to endure the tedium of the roadway, Syverud said he reminds his employees that they are part of a larger mission, using a message that Chris Urmson — one of the architects of Google’s self-driving-car program — used to tell his staff: About 40,000 people die on the roads every year, which is roughly the equivalent of four Boeing 737 Maxes falling out of the sky every week. Nuro’s staffers, Syverud said, have an opportunity to lower those numbers by keeping people off the roads. For employees like Veuleman, that urgent message resonates like a call to duty. During long days inside the car, when it is tempting to take one’s eyes off the road, the former EMT tells himself that though he is no longer saving lives in the present, he may be saving them in the future. “I come from a world where you’re literally helping people and saving lives each day,” Veuleman said. “This role is different. But there is definitely a mission in place, and we believe that making the roads safer can actually change the world.”","November 13, 2019 at 7:00 AM EST",WashingtonPost,NA,The future of autonomous delivery may be unfolding in an unlikely place: Suburban Houston,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/07/future-autonomous-delivery-may-be-unfolding-an-unlikely-place-suburban-houston/
Peter Holley,"Since they began appearing on streets last year, electric scooters have been billed as an eco-friendly alternative to gas-guzzling automobiles, especially in traffic-clogged urban areas. Now Hyundai, one of the world’s largest automakers, is exploring the idea of using e-scooters as a compliment to their vehicles instead of an alternative. The company has released an e-scooter prototype that can be mounted and automatically charged on Hyundai and Kia vehicles using electricity that is produced while driving, according to Hyundai (Hyundai has a significant ownership stake in Kia Motors). An upbeat video released by the company shows the foldable scooter –– which looks like it could nearly fit inside a large handbag –– being stored in several potential compartments inside the car. Once the vehicle is parked, the compartments open and the driver is able to quickly transfer from car to scooter. Hyundai said the idea for adding e-scooters to their vehicles comes from research showing that the ‘Last Mile Mobility’ market in the United States, Europe, and China is expected to grow to $500 Billion by 2030. “This is the vehicle-mounted personal scooter which could be featured in future Hyundai Motor Group vehicles,” DongJin Hyun, head of Hyundai Motor Group Robotics Team, said in a statement released by the company . “We want to make our customers’ lives as easy and enjoyable as possible. Our personal electric scooter makes first- and last-mile commuting a joy, while helping to reduce congestion and emissions in city centers.” Electric scooters send more people to the hospital than bicycles and walking, new study finds Hyundai isn’t the first major car company to hawk an electric scooter. Earlier this year, luxury German car-maker BMW unveiled its own electric scooter, according to Bloomberg , a device with limited range (12 miles) and a hefty price tag: $890. The market is full of electric scooters with three times the range at about half that price. BMW’s model will go on sale this month at the company’s German dealerships. Hyundai’s electric scooter appears much smaller than rentable models produced by companies like Bird, Lime, Bolt and Skip. Even so, the company claims the device’s 10.5 Ah lithium battery is powerful enough to help the scooter to achieve a top speed of more than 12 miles per hour and 12 miles distance on a single charge. Hyundai says the “tri-folding” scooter weighs just under 17 pounds and features a digital display that shows battery status and speed. At night, the new scooter is equipped with two front LED headlights and two rear tail lamps. The automaker says its engineers have added suspension to the device’s front wheel for a smoother ride. After death of YouTube star, Amazon will push for e-scooter safety warnings in the U.K. At first glance, Hyundai experimenting with an e-scooter might look like a marketing gimmick, but David Liniado, vice president of new growth and development at Cox Automotive Mobility Group, said he expects more automakers to embrace micromobility innovations as cities begin to encourage alternative modes of transportation as well. For drivers living and working in crowded urban centers like Atlanta and Washington D.C., where parking is often scarce, being able to transition from a car to a scooter could prove extremely useful, he said, especially if the vehicle also served as the scooter’s charging station. “Going from a car to a bike to a scooter is a trend that is going to continue to grow because there’s utility in it,” Liniado said. “Obviously, somebody living in suburbia, their lifestyle may not need this as someone living in midtown Atlanta.” Liniado said micromobility trends might accelerate if more cities begin follow the lead of Madrid, Spain, where plans to ban most petrol and diesel cars in the city’s center have been fiercely debated in recent months . In Paris, which has struggled with poor air quality, the first Sunday of each month is car free in the city’s center. London plans a similar ban for a single day later this month, an effort designed to encourage residents to explore the city in ways that don’t cause pollution, according to the Guardian . “You may see a day not too soon where you need to park in designated urban areas and walk, bike or scooter to your final destination,” Liniado said. “If you can drive to work and park at work you don’t need a scooter, but there’s tons of use cases where you might have multiple destinations once you park your car, and a scooter would simplify your ability to move around.""

Peter Holley,"When dealing with someone experiencing a mental-health crisis, one of the most valuable tools a police officer has is empathy. Being able to empathize with the victim, experts say, is often the first step in de-escalating a crisis before it turns even more chaotic or dangerous. And yet, in a high-pressure situation, when a first responder is confronting someone in the throes of a suicidal or psychotic episode, empathetic feelings are often replaced by another feeling entirely: paralyzing fear. “They’re showing up to various scenes with an adrenaline spike,” Laura Brown, senior director of training at Axon, a technology company best known for making Tasers that has also become the country’s biggest seller of police body cameras. “The innate fear reaction is the most important thing police need to learn how to regulate during situations involving people suffering from mental-health issues.” A maker of police body cameras won’t use facial recognition yet, for two reasons: Bias and inaccuracy Axon doesn’t necessarily want officers to use the company’s Tasers each time the opportunity arises. Instead, company officials say, they want to help law enforcement officers become more familiar with using empathy to resolve emergency situations when confusion is high and verbal commands lose their effectiveness. To aid in that goal, Axon has released “empathy development training” based in virtual reality. In recent months, the company has unveiled similar virtual training — using Oculus Go virtual reality headsets — to prepare first responders for scenarios involving people with autism and schizophrenia . The latest virtual training is focused on suicide prevention. “The ability to tell the difference between someone who’s acting in an unusual way that may be due to their autism versus someone who could be a risk to you can be a really fine line,” David Kearon of the advocacy group Autism Speaks told the Associated Press in May . “When you’re trying to make that judgment very quickly, that’s where we see mistakes made.” Today, Axon announced its new empathy development training for suicide prevention based in #VR . The training will be made available to agencies in recognition of #WorldSuicidePreventionMonth . Click here for a look into this training: https://t.co/e3IxTydwq5  #protectlife  #wspd Axon is the latest major organization to harness virtual reality as a means of preparing people for operating in complex, high-pressure environments where there is little room for error. Long popular with gamers drawn to immersive fantasy worlds, VR headsets are increasingly being used by scientists, doctors and the military . Last year, biology students at Arizona State University were given the option of purchasing $400 Lenovo Mirage Solo headsets to complete a biology course that incorporated simulated lab environments. More recently, Walmart — the nation’s largest employer — has begun replacing paper-based assessments with tests based in virtual simulations. Using a $250 Oculus Go virtual reality headset, employees have their wits and instincts tested inside a simulated environment, allowing managers to see how well they know the store’s departments and how they react in everyday scenarios, according to the company. Walmart has added virtual reality to its assessment of an employee’s potential In its use of empathy training scenarios, in particular, law enforcement is beginning to view virtual reality as a useful tool. In the future, experts say, virtual reality could be used to review body-camera evidence, recruit new officers, conduct weapons training or be used as a therapy tool for officers suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Using virtual reality to enhance empathy and awareness is not entirely new. The Weather Channel has used immersive mixed-reality technology to impress upon people the importance of evacuating ahead of a hurricane, using terrifying imagery to deliver lifesaving information they might otherwise ignore. At the Tribeca Film Festival last year, filmmakers debuted “1000 Cut Journey,” a virtual reality experience in which the viewer takes on the role of Michael Sterling, a black man who experiences racism at different points in his life. (It was created in concert with Courtney Cogburn, a Columbia University researcher who oversaw the social science aspects.) To develop their suicide prevention training, Axon turned to clinicians, behavioral analysts and law enforcement experts to design an immersive experience that places trainees in a realistic scenario involving a mental-health crisis, the company said. In addition to having users hear the thoughts of a suicidal individual, the scenario allows them to make critical decisions about how to engage with the simulation, such as reassuring the troubled subject, asking about their history or keeping the individual talking. One solution for keeping traffic stops from turning violent: A robot that separates police officers from drivers When mental-health crises go awry, Brown said, it’s often because officers are overwhelmed by fear and unable to control their biometric response or process information effectively. “If you’ve ever had to go onstage and give a speech in front of a big crowd and been overwhelmed by the moment, it’s kind of like that,” she said. Out of the 992 deadly police shootings in the United States in 2018 , Axon notes, 213 of those fatally shot suffered from a mental illness. Fatal Force , a multiyear Washington Post study cataloguing every fatal shooting nationwide by a police officer since 2016, reveals that at least 127 people suffering from mental illness have been fatally shot by police in 2019, or about 19 percent of all those fatally shot by police this year. Even when stun guns are deployed effectively, the weapons have been linked to numerous deaths , particularly when the devices are used to subdue the mentally ill. Ideally, an officer who is a member of a crisis intervention team (CIT) — a program in which officers are trained to identify and de-escalate mental-health crisis — would respond to situations like the one outlined in Axon’s virtual training. But often, Brown said, officers may not suspect they’re dealing with a mental-health crisis until they’re at the scene. A suicidal person standing on the edge of a building — the scenario presented in the Axon’s virtual training scenario — for example, might initially be reported as a trespassing call. In the virtual scenario, Brown said, photo realism and being able to hear the pain in someone’s voice helps trainees develop empathy. “Empathy is the ability to understand what someone else is feeling, and that means really understanding the context that they’re in from a 360-degree perspective,” Brown said. “We’re asking them to empathize with states of being that are some of the most stigmatized and judged in our culture.” MORE READING: Hyundai’s solution for navigating traffic-clogged cities: Mounting an electric scooter on your car Zum, a ride-hailing company for kids, expands to six more U.S. cities, including D.C.

Peter Holley,"Oblong and glassy, with the ability to glide across water without making a sound, the SeaBubble looks like a vehicle straight out of a James Bond flick . Despite resembling a Hollywood contrivance, the vehicle is actually a potentially new form of electric, urban transportation that could offer Parisians a watery alternative to hailing a taxi, driving a car or hopping on an electric scooter . Known as a “flying taxi,” the boat can reach 20 miles per hour as it rises nearly 30 inches above the water using wing-like structures known as “hydrofoils” that are designed to reduce drag. Inside, the vehicle holds up to four passengers, who face one another as if riding in a London taxi, according to Le Parisien , whose reporter snagged a ride inside the futuristic vehicle. Designers say the taxi — which has been tested up and down the river Seine in the heart of Paris — can be hailed using a smartphone app and could be available for rides as early as next year, pending final licensing. The lithium battery-powered vehicle with butterfly doors already has captured the attention of social media . A German startup just completed its first test of a new on-demand air taxi Lined by serene walking paths and quaint house boats squeezed against the riverbank, the Seine has always been a giant avenue flowing through Paris, trafficked by barges carrying commercial goods and river boats and cruise ships packed with tourists. Speaking to Reuters , SeaBubbles co-founder Alain Thebault said his vehicle is unique among this flow of aquatic traffic because it produces no sound and no pollution, making it an energy efficient alternative to gas-powered boats. “It’s the future,” he said. Thebault envisions a fleet of SeaBubbles, in both Paris and other cities, that alleviate “global gridlock” created by billions of cars on the road. Even if those cars are powered by clean energies, the startup’s website says , they’ll still create a “massive traffic jam.” “We believe that the future of mobility will rise from the water,” the sites adds. How would it work? After ordering a ride, passengers would enter the vehicle with the help of a hostess and take their seats inside the SeaBubble, according to a description on the company’s website, which notes that the interior was modeled after automobile interiors. After securing the doors and leaving the dock, the boat begins “flying” above the water at 7.5 miles per hour using its foils, “preventing any seasickness, sudden movements or rolling waves,” the site claims. Foils, which have been around for decades and are not unlike small aircraft wings for the water, can be attached to a boat’s hull , allowing the vehicle to skim above the water with less resistance and at higher speed. “Once the ride is over, the bubble slowly comes back to the water level to reach the dock, letting its passengers out and waiting for the next ones to board,” the site adds. In five years, SeaBubbles — which were conceived as being halfway between a boat and a plane — ambitiously plans for the company to be in 50 cities around the globe. Thebault told Le Parisien that his company is already fielding questions about the vehicle from luxury hotels and multiple municipalities, none of which were named. The price: about $150,000 each, the paper reported. An electric water taxi might someday compete with similar hybrid machines that are envisioned to crisscross cities from above. For several years now, a handful of companies have been jockeying to be the first to deliver an on-demand air taxi service. Earlier this year, Lilium, a Munich-based startup founded in 2015, unveiled an electric, five-seat air-taxi prototype that it claims uses the same amount of electricity as an electric car. Powered by 36 jet engines, but lacking a tail, rudder and propellers, the aircraft is designed to take-off and land vertically and has a range of about 185 miles in 60 minutes on a single charge. It completed a test flight earlier this year. Zum, a ride-hailing company for kids, expands to six more U.S. cities, including D.C. Companies such as Uber , Airbus , Rolls-Royce Holdings (the aircraft engine manufacturer, not the luxury car brand owned by Germany’s BMW) and Volocopter also are developing flying cars with a single hope: to bypass traffic-clogged streets below. Uber plans to create a network of flying taxis in Dubai and the Dallas area by the year 2020. Kitty Hawk — a flying car startup created by Google co-founder Larry Page — is already offering test flights to potential customers.

Peter Holley,"The Internet gawks each time Boston Dynamics releases a new video showing its eye-catching humanoid robot, Atlas, performing newly acquired acrobatic tricks. But until now, most of the machine’s maneuvering — whether it was jogging, hopping over a log or executing box jumps — has remained well within the realm of average human athleticism. Not anymore. If the tech company’s recently uploaded video is any indication, Atlas has, in a matter of months, graduated from middle-school gym class to something approaching a professional athlete. In the 38-second video, the sturdy, battery-powered machine — standing 4 foot 9 inches and weighing 176 pounds — unleashes an exceedingly nimble routine (using its legs, arms and torso) with a degree of gracefulness that you’d expect from a human being with years of training. “We created the maneuvers using new techniques that streamline the development process,” Boston Dynamics wrote in the video’s description. “First, an optimization algorithm transforms high-level descriptions of each maneuver into dynamically-feasible reference motions. Then Atlas tracks the motions using a model predictive controller that smoothly blends from one maneuver to the next.” Despite that smoothness, the robot isn’t perfect, according to its handlers. “Using this approach, we developed the routine significantly faster than previous Atlas routines, with a performance success rate of about 80%,” the description adds. For his latest trick, Atlas the headless humanoid robot does parkour Within hours of being posted online, the latest Atlas video had racked up nearly 1.5 million views and thousands of comments, many of them suggesting the robot’s newfound athleticism was evidence that mankind’s reign over machines is nearing its expiration date. “So we just going to keep acting like we never seen Terminator?” one commenter wrote. “Absolutely amazing!” added another. “I can smell the future where robots are roaming in the streets with us!” In recent years, Boston Dynamics has become known for two things: creating robots whose movements mimic humans and animals with a degree of accuracy that many find surprising, if not unnerving. And then, without warning, posting cryptic videos of those robots online, where they quickly go viral, capturing some mixture of excitement and terror about the rapid rise of autonomous machines. Boston Dynamics was purchased by Japan’s Softbank from Alphabet in 2017. In recent years, it has produced four-legged robots — with names like Spot, Wildcat and BigDog — that can open doors, carry heavy loads and run nearly 20 miles per hour , but its most recognizable product appears to be Atlas, the humanoid athlete that Boston Dynamics labels, “the world’s most dynamic humanoid robot.” Guided by lidar — a sensor that uses a pulsed laser sensor to measure the distance between objects — and stereo vision, the compact robot is able to haul nearly 25 pounds. Boston Dynamics says Atlas can also manipulate objects in its environment, traverse rough terrain, keep its balance when pushed and get back up when tipped over. New video shows a humanoid robot crossing a balance beam with ease As recently as three years ago, Atlas was recorded awkwardly tramping through the snow at a slow speed, its mechanical body lacking any of the fluidity and agility that it displays now. Curiosity about Atlas gained momentum last year when Boston Dynamics posted a 34-second clip on YouTube showing the formerly halting robot going for a casual and smooth-looking jog in a grassy residential area. The video, which captured the distinct photocopier-like sound created by the robot’s movements, seemed to catch many viewers by surprise, including the Daily Mail , which covered Atlas’s physical feat at the time. “If you thought you’d be able to run away from the terrifying new breed of robots,” the paper wrote, “bad news.” MORE READING: MIT’s latest dog-like robot can do backflips on command New video shows a humanoid robot crossing a balance beam with ease Boston Dynamics’ latest video shows a herd of robotic dogs hauling a massive truck with ease","September 25, 2019 at 8:00 AM EDT",WashingtonPost,NA,Three years ago it could barely walk.

Peter Holley,"About 48 hours remained before the tiny service station in Takoma Park, Md., known as RS Automotive, was scheduled to start refueling vehicles again after a months-long delay. Unfortunately, a nagging problem persisted. For more than 60 years, the pumps in front of this tidy blue-and-white service station that easily blends into the neighborhood’s quaint streetscape have offered customers gasoline. On Thursday, according to Maryland officials, RS Automotive became the first service station in the nation to completely convert its equipment from offering gasoline — the flammable fuel that powers internal combustion engines and global conflicts alike — to electric power, the sustainable stuff that many see as the heart of America’s decarbonized future. But one important detail remained: Nobody, including the station’s longtime owner or the Electric Vehicle Institute — a Baltimore-based company spearheading the transition with the help of a state grant program — was entirely sure what to call a gas station that doesn’t offer ... well, gas. “We settled on ‘EV charging station,’ but we also thought about calling it a ‘refueling center,’ ” Matthew Wade, EVI’s chief executive, explained during a tour of the site, noting that the goal was to avoid confusion among the non-EV-adopting public. “The terminology here is so loose because all of this is so new.” GM claims the Chevy Bolt gets 238 miles per charge. Here’s why that’s misleading. So new, it seems, that in some ways, the unanswered questions have a way of feeling wildly outdated, conjuring up distant memories of the early 20th century, when automotive technology was brand new and America’s fledgling driving culture was still being defined . Among them: What sort of information should the station’s signs communicate to the public? Better yet, does an EV charging station even need signage in the first place? EV owners can find charging stations anywhere in the world using a smartphone, after all. Perhaps most important: What exactly will people do with themselves during the 15- to 30-minute window when their vehicles are charging? Will they linger awkwardly? Grab a bite to eat nearby? Sit in their vehicles and work? Or relax in the station’s new “state-of-the-art EV lounge”? The charging station is as much social experimentation as it is economic. If successful, Wade said, it could provide a model for replication elsewhere. “Nobody really knows what will happen,” he said. “We’ve entered new territory, and in some ways, that’s very exciting.” We’ve been through a gas-powered version of this experiment before. The first drive-in service station opened in Pennsylvania in 1913, according to the Smithsonian . Before then, motorists frequented curbside pumps or purchased gasoline “in cans from places like pharmacies and blacksmith shops and filled up themselves,” the publication notes. Now, more than a century later, the front lines of a new EV revolution are unfolding not only among hypercompetitive engineers in Detroit and Silicon Valley but also in a quiet, free-spirited community known for its aging hippies in Teva sandals and its “ nuclear-free zone ” ordinance, a bastion of bike-friendly lanes with one of the state’s highest walkability scores . Fittingly, Depeswar Doley, a friendly Takoma Park fixture and RS Automotive’s owner since 1997, said he doesn’t know how much money the new charging stations will net his business — and doesn’t particularly seem to care, so long as he can continue paying his staff a living wage while cutting ties with Big Oil. “The volume of our gasoline sales was very low, especially after 8 p.m.,” Doley said. “I don’t expect to get super rich from this, but it’s good for the environment, and I’m willing to take the risk.” Fortunately for Doley, the region is not without potential customers. In addition to an electric taxi service in nearby Washington, D.C., Maryland has nearly 21,000 registered EVs on its roads. Until now, Takoma Park’s only two EV charging stations were being dominated by area taxis, Wade said. Even if taxis take advantage of the new pumps, Wade and Doley are expecting a public adjustment period. Gone are the pumps that American motorists have been using to pump their own gas at filling stations since 1905. They’ve been replaced by handheld “dispensers,” which are attached to four flashy, nine-foot-tall charging stations with bright LED lights, touch-screens and credit card slots. The machines gave Doley an excuse to replace the site’s gargantuan, 20,000-gallon supply tanks, which were dug up and discarded this summer. Eventually, the plan is to outfit the station, as well as the garage and canopy that shields the charging stations, with solar panels. The full renovation was funded by EVI as well as the Maryland Energy Administration, which provided a grant of $786,000. ‘People are freaking out.’ Will electric vehicles doom your neighborhood auto mechanic? “Maryland is proud to be a national leader when it comes to clean and renewable energy, climate change and the promotion of electric infrastructure and vehicles,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said in a news release . “This fully converted gas-to-electric charging station is a prime example of our administration’s commitment to the environment and transportation.” Unlike the rest of the state’s service stations, RS Automotive won’t have the familiar flip signs or LED displays that show varying fuel prices by grade. An EV driver pulling up to a charging station likely will have been directed there — and made aware of the price — by an app on their smartphone like PlugShare, which maintains a database of EV charging stations around the world. Also gone is some of the quick convenience drivers have come to expect when they pull up to the pump. Instead of filling up in less than five minutes, the 200-kilowatt charging stations will charge most EVs to 80 percent capacity in about 15 to 30 minutes. At that point, vehicles typically slow the charging rate to protect their batteries. The average cost for an 80 percent charge: about $5.10. “The final trickle of charging, the last 5 percent, can take an hour,” Wade said. “We suggest you get to 80 percent to maximize the charging session.” EV companies are already addressing this issue and will have larger battery packs and faster battery management systems, Wade added, but for now, most customers should allot the same amount of time toward a charging session that they would for, say, a thorough carwash. To help them in this effort, RS Automotive has designed an EV lounge. Part waiting room and part living room, the lounge will offer complimentary coffee, water and restrooms, as well as several couches, chairs and televisions, including one screen displaying charging percentages at each station. “It’s going to be different,” Wade said. “People are going to stay here a bit longer instead of just standing there holding the pump.” On a recent afternoon, a steady stream of Takoma Park residents strolled past the newly installed charging stations, some stopping to ask questions or snap photos. Not all of them have embraced the idea of longer wait times. “It’s a pain in the butt not to have gas here,” said 86-year-old Andy Kelemen, wearing colorful suspenders and sandals, who has been coming to the gas station for more than three decades. “You better have that lounge well done, because I’m not gonna stand here holding something for 20 minutes."" But down the block, the barbers at Roland’s Unisex Barber Shop said they welcomed the idea of idling customers with time on their hands. “I welcome anything that’s going to add a pulse to the neighborhood,” said 64-year-old barber Melvin Dawes, who said he remembers when the neighborhood was crisscrossed by dirt roads. “It’s going to draw more people around here, and that enhances the rest of the businesses.” “Twenty minutes is the perfect amount of time for a haircut,” he added. When Doley was approached about converting to electric power, he said he was already looking for an excuse to sever his ties with oil and gasoline companies. He was tired of lengthy contracts that included clauses that extended agreements when particular sales figures weren’t met. If his electric experiment fails, he said, his new year-to-year lease means he can always reverse course. In the end, Doley said, embracing electric power wasn’t so much about contracts or profit but the enthusiasm his 17-year-old daughter displayed when he initially floated the idea past her. “My daughter said, ‘Dad, we gotta do it!' ” he said. “She’s very passionate about Tesla and the environment, and we listened to her because she’s the younger generation.” MORE READING: Three years ago it could barely walk.

Peter Holley,"Earlier this year, thousands of flights began landing at Istanbul’s new $11 billion airport , a sprawling behemoth that occupies an area larger than Manhattan and may eventually become the world’s busiest air hub. How do you help millions of harried passengers each year navigate an 818 million-square-foot facility with five concourses and 143 boarding gates. One answer, according to airport officials, is a fleet of humanoid robots. Specially designed for the new facility, the wheeled robots are a first for Turkish airports, according to an airport-produced video introducing the machines to the public. About the size of a small child, the eggshell-blue machines have bright digital faces with cartoonish round eyes and an ever-present smile that appears designed to put people at ease. Three years ago it could barely walk. Now Atlas the humanoid robot is doing gymnastics. When the robots speak, their mouths flash, their eyes wink and the machine’s arms move up and down. A touch screen attached to the robot’s chest allows customers to interact with the machine. “My capabilities include route showing, giving directions, inquiring about flight schedule and flight information status,” the robot says between videos of the machine assisting customers and spinning in circles. “I am looking forward to meeting new passengers at Istanbul Airport every day.” The Istanbul Airport video doesn’t reveal whether the machines have a name or how many will roam the concourse, but Business Traveller reported that there are four robots on hand. At a time when airports and the number of people passing through them continue to grow, the robots are an effort to make travel more manageable. When completed, Istanbul’s airport — 20 miles outside the city on the Black Sea coast — will be able to transport as many as 200 million passengers a year. For perspective, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta — currently considered the world’s busiest — processes about half that number. “We’re starting to arrive at scales which were previously unimaginable for the size of these airport buildings,” Andrew Thomas, a partner at the architectural firm Grimshaw, which designed the Istanbul airport, told the New York Times last year . “It almost doesn’t matter what you put in it if the walks are so long that people are exhausted by the time they get to their gate."" Friendly nurse or nightmare-inducing machine? How culture programs our taste in robots. Istanbul’s airport robots may be innovative and on trend, but they’re not exactly groundbreaking. Perhaps you’ve heard of Pepper, for example. In addition to being spotted eerily tapping a drum while performing Buddhist funeral rites in Japan , the doe-eyed humanoid robot has also been interacting with British passengers at a railway station in central London (including posing for selfies). Pepper recently emerged at an airline in Taiwan , as well, it’s shiny crown strikingly bald yet cheerful. At one of France’s busiest airports, self-driving robotic valets named “Stan” have been parking travelers’ vehicles for months, a process the company claims is far more efficient than human drivers. Humanoid robots on wheels with digital expressions have popped up in other busy, high-stress locations, such as hospitals. When officials at Mongkutwattana General Hospital in Bangkok needed help moving mountains of paperwork earlier this year, they turned to a fleet of humanoid robots , which they outfitted in bright yellow dresses and shoulder-length brown wigs. Adding an element of the supernatural, the unsmiling Chinese-made machines also have two blazing red eyes — each one massive and ghoulish — that glare from behind a darkened pane of transparent plastic like a demonic predator lurking in the dark. Their names: Nan, Nee and Nim. MORE READING: Amazon is reportedly building a home robot.

Peter Holley,"In research centers around the world, roboticists have for decades been on a quest to perfect bipedal locomotion in machines. They’re making progress, but for all the flashy shots of back-flipping , log-hopping robots racking up views on YouTube, researchers say, there are far more failures and dead ends that the public never sees. That’s because bipedal locomotion –– while extremely useful for moving humans up stairs, over mountains or across complex surfaces –– offers so little room for error in machines. While people can generally pick themselves up after falling over, taking our complex ability to regain balance for granted, researchers say, it’s still exceedingly difficult to design an upright walking robot that can do the same, especially as it moves across different surfaces. Instead of creating more sophisticated computer programs to enhance robotic balance, researchers at Caltech’s Center for Autonomous Systems and Technology decided to bypass the issue altogether by removing gravity from the equation. The result is a newly-unveiled machine that they’ve dubbed Leonardo, which stands for “LEg ON Aerial Robotic DrOne.” Three years ago it could barely walk. Now Atlas the humanoid robot is doing gymnastics. Part bipedal robot, part aerial drone, the hybridized machine was inspired by birds’ ability to move between flight and walking on two legs. Two powerful rotors on the machine’s torso allow it to leave the ground when it’s convenient or regain balance by using thrust to shift its weight as needed. Leonardo is innovative because its design pushes back against the notion that a robot should be strictly land or air-based, according to Professor Morteza Gharib, director of the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories at Caltech, who co-developed Leonardo with Caltech roboticist Soon-Jo Chung. “This is not a drone,” Gharib said, noting that the machine can fly, but it isn’t designed to do so at high altitude for long stretches of time. ""The rotors attached to its torso kick in when basically it loses balance or when the robot needs to create stability.” “We are very excited,” he added. “I can go and kick this one very hard, and it doesn’t fall over."" Aside from the satisfaction of bringing an ambitious idea to life, Gharib said researchers are even more excited about Leonardo because of the many possibilities the machine’s unique design could someday offer. Gharib said he can envision the robot being used for inspections on oil rigs or wind turbines –– places where a bipedal robot could be useful, but at risk of falling. The machines could also be dropped from an airplane, perhaps in groups, to aid in search and rescue missions, he said. Future versions could also be used to navigate the harsh terrain found on other planets like Mars. And unlike drones, he noted, having stabilizing legs means the robot would be able to carry heavier batteries, giving the machine more power and versatility. “I can envision this robot helping a geologist when they go on out into the field,” Gharib said. “They’d be able to carry equipment and then fly overhead and take steady images, becoming a scientists or an engineer’s companion."" “There’s a perception that robots will take over the world and harm mankind, but our community is developing machines that will help society first,"" he added. New video shows a humanoid robot crossing a balance beam with ease A video released by Caltech –– which has racked up more than 23,000 views –– shows the robot delicately balancing on a ledge, spinning on one leg and walking up and downhill using its “thrusters” for balance. The current model is about two and a half feet tall and weighs less than 10 pounds, but Gharib said future models will double in size and grow increasingly fast and stable as machine learning algorithms improve the robot’s movement with more experience. The Caltech team is certainly not the first to dream of creating futuristic machines with the ability to shift between different forms of locomotion. At this year’s CES technology show in Las Vegas, Hyundai i ntroduced a concept car designed to walk as easily as it rolls. Called “Elevate,” the daddy-long-legs-like machine has wheels at the end of long robotic legs that would allow “users to drive, walk or even climb over the most treacherous terrain,” according to the company . The company — which labeled the machine a UMV, or “ultimate mobility vehicle” — said the concept was inspired by the need for “resilient transportation” in disaster zones, where conventional vehicles are often rendered useless. “When a tsunami or earthquake hits, current rescue vehicles can only deliver first responders to the edge of the debris field,” John Suh, Hyundai vice president and head of Hyundai CRADLE, said in a statement on the company’s website. “They have to go the rest of the way by foot. Elevate can drive to the scene and climb right over flood debris or crumbled concrete.” MORE READING: Japanese researchers want to give granny a robotic monkey tail The latest tool to help police develop empathy for the public: Virtual reality headsets Meet ‘Mindar,’ the robotic Buddhist priest","October 9, 2019 at 2:20 PM EDT",WashingtonPost,NA,"Caltech’s latest creation: A hovering, bird-like robot that could someday explore Mars",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/09/caltechs-latest-creation-hovering-bird-like-robot-that-could-someday-explore-mars/
Peter Holley,"If you’re leaving home and headed out into a big city, it’s never been easier to avoid walking. Aside from major ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, urban dwellers suddenly have access to an assortment of electric scooter companies , easily accessible bike shares, car shares and mopeds , not to mention electric skateboards and onewheels . Just when you thought you’d never have to partake in bipedal locomotion ever again, a Boston robotics company is banking on the idea that its latest creation will convince you to do exactly that. That creation — announced today and hitting the market next month — is called “gita” (pronounced “jee-ta” and spelled with a lowercase “g”), a brightly colored, carbon-fiber robot that looks like some futuristic mixture of an exercise ball and cooler, or perhaps a commercial-size rice cooker flipped on its side and strapped to a pair of rubber bicycle wheels. Its only purpose: to follow you wherever you go, dutifully toting your belongings like a mini pack mule on wheels (minus the animal welfare concerns). Greg Lynn, co-founder and chief executive officer of Piaggio Fast Forward, a Boston start-up owned by scooter-maker Vespa, said the robot will compete with last-mile transportation solutions like e-scooters and ride-hailing companies. Istanbul’s new airport is one of the world’s largest. A fleet of humanoid robots is helping passengers find their way around. That might sound counterintuitive considering you can’t ride gita, but Lynn foresees an overlapping customer base, especially in urban settings. “We’re trying to unlock the value of walkability in American towns and cities with a device that will appeal to people that are primarily driving and taking Ubers for their short errands and trips,” Lynn said, noting that, unlike e-scooters, gita won’t crowd busy sidewalks or put pedestrians at risk of physical harm. “And we’re trying to convince people that it’s mentally and physically healthier to walk that mile instead of electric scootering or bicycle-sharing it.” “At a walking speed, after all, you’re more connected to your environment,” he added. The company’s motto: “Autonomy for humans.”  Spot will carry his own gear, but that doesn't mean you have to. #gitarobot A post shared by gitarobot (@gitarobot) on Oct 8, 2019 at 8:32am PDT  Walk to the grocery store without having to cut back on heavy foods and fruits. gita will follow behind carrying up to 40 pounds of belongings. #gitarobot A post shared by gitarobot (@gitarobot) on Oct 3, 2019 at 10:00am PDT Following its owner at up to six miles per hour, gita can carry up to 40 pounds of belongings inside an inner compartment that is big enough to hold about two grocery bags, according to Piaggio Fast Forward. The 22-inch-tall vehicle has up to four hours of battery time, relies on multiple cameras for navigation and is designed to operate on hard surfaces (no snow or sand). How does gita follow its owner? The robot pairs to its owner’s legs with cameras that scan and track their motion. The vehicle can also discern when other people enter its field of view, allowing the robot to go around them and continue following its paired user. Don’t worry, the company says, unlike a smartphone or an e-scooter, gita doesn’t track its owner’s location, and the robot’s cameras do not record or store video or images. Gita cannot climb stairs, but it can move around any building with elevators or ramps. Also worth noting is that gita cannot speak, communicating instead via sound and buttons that can be pressed to turn on or adjust it. The robot’s creators worked with the Berklee College of Music in Boston to compose a library of distinct sounds — which adjust dynamically according to the volume of ambient noise surrounding the robot — to indicate gita’s battery level or when the robot is ready to pair with its owner. The cost: $3,250. Asked whether gita might offer lonely walkers some form of subtle companionship, Lynn said the robot was designed to look stylish, but its visage is subdued and somewhat impersonal. “We didn’t want people feeling too self-conscious while they were being followed by a robot,” he said, noting that the machine lacks humanlike facial features. The machine can be shared with the owner’s “crew,” a small group of people selected by the robot’s primary owner. The company says tests have revealed that trips using the robot typically involve at least two people. Jeffrey Schnapp, Piaggio Fast Forward co-founder and chief visionary officer, said moving around the world with your hands object-free means a pedestrian can more fully interact with their environment, whether that means being more curious or socializing without distraction. “We see gita as support for someone’s daily life and an extension of yourself, but we also see it serving as a type of connective tissue among friends,” Schnapp said. First, the robot’s creators admit, they’ll have to familiarize the public with the idea of a robot that acts as an extension of its owner. When people are shown photos of the robot, Lynn said, some assume the machine is designed to “deliver a burrito to your front door.” If they’re able to build awareness, the company hopes gita’s appeal will move beyond tech bros and urban millennials looking for an expensive picnic toy. Schnapp said he believes the robot could also appeal to older people or individuals with disabilities, for example, who might benefit from having a machine to help carry groceries and run errands with added support. “That population of people is active and moves around their community, but isn’t the demographic for mopeds and scooters,” he added. “We think this is a way to serve their needs as well.” MORE READING: Caltech’s latest creation: A hovering, birdlike robot that could someday explore Mars D.C.-area gas station shuts off the pumps and goes all-electric Three years ago it could barely walk.

Peter Holley,"Solving a Rubik’s Cube with two hands is hard for most people. Solving a Rubik’s Cube with one hand is even harder. Harder still: Designing a lone robot hand capable of solving a Rubik’s Cube all by itself. Such a machine would require unprecedented dexterity and coordinated finger joint movements, as well as the ability to learn a new task over time and independently the way a human would. Researchers at OpenAI — a well-known San Francisco-based research lab focused on developing benevolent artificial intelligence — recently announced they’d done just that, achieving a new robotics benchmark in an era of increasingly sophisticated intelligent machines. In a statement hailing their work, researchers said the robotic hand, which they’ve dubbed Dactyl, moves robots one step closer to “human-level dexterity.” “Solving a Rubik’s Cube requires unprecedented dexterity and the ability to execute flawlessly or recover from mistakes successfully for a long period of time,” the statement said. “Even for humans, solving a Rubik’s Cube one-handed is no simple task — there are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 ways to scramble a Rubik’s Cube.” With this result, the statement added, researchers move closer to creating “general purpose robots with a technique that should allow for robustly solving any simulatable dexterous tasks.” How quickly can AI solve a Rubik’s Cube? In less time than it took you to read this headline. The multicolored, three-dimensional puzzles have befuddled game-playing humans since the 1970s, but Rubik’s Cubes have more recently proved a useful tool for measuring the capabilities of artificial intelligence. For years now, some researchers have been programming robots to solve Rubik’s Cubes as quickly as possible . But more recently, they’ve begun prioritizing self-learning over speed. In July, the University of California at Irvine announced that an artificial intelligence system solved a Rubik’s cube in just over a second, besting the current human world record by more than two seconds. For some researchers, like those at the University of California Irvine, the cube has offered a novel way to challenge an artificially-intelligent algorithm. That’s because there are billions of potential moves available to a Rubik’s Cube player, with the puzzle’s six sides and nine sections, but only one goal: each of the cube’s six sides displaying a solid color. Finding a solution to a puzzle with that degree of complexity, and among billions of potentialities, involves a degree of abstract thinking, UC Irvine researchers say, that begins to approximate human reasoning and decision-making. In contrast, OpenAI’s robotic hand wasn’t engineered for the specific purpose of solving Rubik’s Cubes, but rather on physical manipulation of the puzzle. The UC Irvine system, known as DeepCubeA — a reinforcement-learning algorithm programmed by computer scientists and mathematicians at Irvine— solved the puzzle without prior knowledge of the game or coaching from its human handlers, according to the university. Highly skilled humans are able to conquer a Rubik’s Cube in about 50 moves, but the AI system is able to solve the cube in about 20, usually in the minimum number of steps possible, researchers said. The Irvine algorithm relies on a neural network — a set of algorithms designed to find underlying relationships by mimicking how the human brain processes information. The algorithm also relied on machine learning techniques, a system that allows AI to learn by identifying patterns and using inference with minimal human intervention. To prepare Dactyl for Rubik’s Cube success, OpenAI’s researchers say they didn’t “explicitly program” the machine to solve the puzzle. Instead, the robot was trained using virtual simulations before it was presented with challenges in the physical world that tested its ability to learn. The goal, researchers say, was to create a robot that learns the way humans do — through trial and error. Eventually, those robots could be used to complete tasks — in a warehouse or perhaps on the surface of another planet — with more autonomy. Before it could solve the puzzle, Dactyl was forced to learn how to hold and move the cube on its own. As Dactyl improved at each stage of learning, its algorithm growing more adept, the challenges intensified. “For example,” researchers said, “we put a rubber glove on the hand, we tied some of its fingers together, we used a blanket to occlude and perturb the hand, and we poked the Rubik’s Cube with different objects all while it continued to try to solve the Rubik’s Cube.” The system had never seen anything similar to these situations during training, researchers added. Insanely fast teen sets Rubik’s cube world record at Maryland competition OpenAI posted a video on YouTube showing Dactyl at various points in the robot’s training arc. The video captures the machine learning from scratch as it awkwardly fumbles with a Rubik’s Cube and later handling the puzzle with much more control and precision. The video’s narrator says Dactyl’s accomplishment could also change how researchers view training general-purpose robots. Instead of thinking about creating complex algorithms for different environments, the narrator says, roboticists can instead focus on designing complex scenarios in which the machines can learn. “At some point,” the narrator adds, “then it would be more down to the imagination what robots could actually accomplish.” “The hope is to build robots that can do many different tasks to increase the standard of living and give everybody a better life,” the narrator adds. Correction: OpenAI focused their research on physical manipulation of a Rubik’s Cube using a robotic hand, not on solving the puzzle. A previous version of this article suggested that researchers were using software to solve the Rubik’s Cube as other researchers have done in the past. The reference has now been removed.

Peter Holley,"Are you exceptionally fond of your face? More specifically: Are you so fond of your face that you would like to see it plastered on a global fleet of humanoid robots for years to come? If you answered “yes” to both questions — which would hardly be surprising in the “selfie” era — a British engineering and manufacturing firm wants to hear from you. That firm, Geomiq, claims it has been hired by a mysterious robotics company to put out a call for photo submissions. The reason: Said company has developed a humanoid robot that is nearing completion but is still in need of the right visage. The line between an epic ego boost and a nightmare from a “Black Mirror” episode, it seems, has never been thinner. In a statement posted online , Geomiq says the robotics company — which remains unnamed because of an apparent nondisclosure agreement — is not looking for just any old face, but a “kind and friendly” one that may be reproduced “on potentially thousands of versions of the robots worldwide,” according to the statement. The blog post does not specify whether designers are seeking a particular age or gender for their robotic face. It’s never been easier to avoid walking. A cargo-carrying robot might change that. Geomiq notes that theirs is a “unique request.” As if trying to outdo that understatement, the company points out that licensing one’s face to a humanoid robotic project of unknown origin is, after all, “potentially an extremely big decision.” Potentially, indeed. But, they add, a nearly $130,000 enticement awaits the bold individual who agrees to let the robotics company license their visage, likely altering the course of their life forever. Because the Internet is an unregulated house of mirrors patrolled by piratical tricksters who traffic in flimflam, it is unclear whether Geomiq’s request is a daring social experiment, a prank or a legitimate plea for assistance. The firm’s statement includes a semi-detailed explanation for their client’s secrecy. “The company is privately-funded and says the robots’ purpose will be to act as a ‘virtual friend’ for elderly people, and is set to go into production next year,” the statement says. “The designer has said that the project has been in development for five years, and has since taken on investment from a number of independent VCs as well as a top fund based in Shanghai.” “The company says the need for anonymity is due to the ‘secretive’ nature of the project, however it believes the robot will soon be ‘readily available’ to the public and hopes the campaign will create extra buzz ahead of its eventual release,” the statement adds. The company claims candidates whose faces advance to the next phase of the selection process can expect full transparency about the nature of the robotics project. Not sure if your face is worthy of gracing a robot army? Don’t fret. There is already a seemingly endless variety of robot faces on the market today, their design often reflective of the machine’s purpose and expected location. Some robots, like the $1 million robotic Buddhist priest, Mindar , have humanlike faces, though they are not always equipped to carry out realistic human expressions . This robotic hand learned to solve a Rubik’s Cube on its own — just like a human. In Thailand, one hospital has introduced robotic nurses whose faces consist largely of two blazing red eyes — each one massive and ghoulish — which glare from behind a darkened pane of transparent plastic like a demonic predator lurking in the dark. The robotic assistant known as Pepper , meanwhile, has a nonthreatening face with cartoonishly large eyes that are designed to put people at ease. In recent years, a growing number of robots have been developed with faces rendered on a screen, offering designers more flexibility in how they define a robot’s personality. Last year, roboticists from the University of Washington in Seattle identified 157 different robots with rendered faces. Researchers categorized the faces according to dozens of attributes and then surveyed people about their reaction to different robotic facial styles. In their paper, “ Characterizing the Design Space of Rendered Robot Faces ,"" researchers report that the plurality of robot faces are black (34.4 percent) and most (65.6 percent) include a mouth, but less than half have eyebrows and even fewer have a nose. Less than one in 10 robots have hair and even fewer have ears. Most robot eyes are white and circular and generally feature pupils. Though seemingly innocuous, a robot’s facial features can have an enormous impact on how they are received by humans, who are hard-wired to recognize and closely read faces. “Faces are critical in establishing the agency of social robots; however, building expressive mechanical faces is costly and difficult,"" the paper states. “We find that participants preferred less realistic and less detailed robots in the home, but highly detailed yet not exceedingly realistic robots for service jobs,"" the paper adds. ""The lack of key features like pupils and mouths resulted in low likability ratings and engendered distrust, leading participants to relegate them to security jobs.” MORE READING: Caltech’s latest creation: A hovering, birdlike robot that could someday explore Mars Istanbul’s new airport is one of the world’s largest.

Peter Holley,"Enduring a lengthy checkout line is a potential annoyance each time you set foot inside a busy grocery store. That’s particularly true during the evening rush , when shoppers descend on grocery stores for last-minute dinner items. Instead of opening more aisles and hiring more cashiers, a Canadian grocery chain says its introducing an innovative pilot program for helping customers bypass lines altogether. On Wednesday, Sobeys — a Nova Scotia-based grocery chain — unveiled Smart Carts, a fleet of 10 intelligent grocery carts that scan and weigh products as customers place them in the cart. The carts feature touch screens that resemble the kind you might find in a self-checkout line. The screens display a running tally of purchases while customers shop and allow them to pay on the spot once they’re finished shopping, according to the company. In a video released by Sobeys, a customer scans and places food items in grocery bags inside the cart instead of going to a checkout line and having purchases bagged by a human employee — a process that Sobeys labels the ""greatest point of customer friction.” “While products and customer eating habits have evolved, the in-store grocery shopping experience has remained relatively static for the last 100 years,” Mathieu Lacoursiere, Sobeys vice president for retail support, said in a company statement. “This is a unique way for us to test innovative new technologies aimed at enhancing the customer shopping experience and learn how best to make it faster and easier. ""The carts will also give our in-store teammates more time to interact with customers and answer questions about food and new products,” the statement added. The Technology 202: Drones in Aisle 5?

Though the industry’s business model had changed little over the past century, as Lacoursiere noted, a customer-driven demand for convenience is forcing the industry to adapt to remain competitive. Now, as the industry finds itself in the midst of a technological upheaval, experts say, local grocery chains are suddenly providing the public with a glimpse of a future far beyond self-service kiosks and online shopping. Over the past year, Kroger, the nation’s largest grocer, has introduced a fleet of autonomous delivery vehicles, and Giant Food Stores has rolled out a series of robotic assistants named “Marty” that scan shelves and identify hazardous spills. Last year, Kroger introduced a system called “ Scan, Bag, Go ” that allows customers to scan and pay for grocery items as they shop — with their smartphone. “We see customers pushing the envelope in the grocery industry and in our business in particular,” said Yael Cosset, Kroger’s chief digital officer, noting that the goal these days is to create as many convenient options for customers to get food as possible on their terms. ""Sometimes that means delivery, and sometimes it’s pickup, and sometimes someone wants to walk into the store. “It doesn’t matter to us if you’re engaging with us through voice, mobile or web — we know you and your purchase history no matter what the touch point is.” Pensa, an Austin-based start-up, has been testing an autonomous robotic drone that scans grocery shelves using an onboard camera. The camera allows the machine to collect valuable data about the store’s ever-changing inventory before uploading its findings to the cloud and setting a supply-chain in motion. For much of this year, Walmart customers have been able to order groceries using a Google assistant, joining Amazon-owned Whole Foods, which partnered with Amazon’s Echo last year so that customers can shop using voice commands. By next year, Walmart — which also sells $200 billion worth of groceries each year and remains the world’s largest private employer, with 1.5 million Americans on its payroll — plans to have autonomous floor-scrubbing robots at nearly half of its 4,700 U.S. stores, part of a major effort to upgrade its business by harnessing the convenience of intelligent machines. This start-up is launching a remote-controlled ‘grocery store on wheels' Sobeys owns or franchises more than 1,500 grocery stores across Canada, including stores in the Safeway, IGA, FreshCo, Foodland and Thrifty Foods chains, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation . Sobeys says their Smart Carts — which were developed by Caper , a retail technology start-up based in New York City — will only grow more intelligent with use. The grocery chain says the carts are equipped with AI and machine learning technology. As the carts improve, the company says, the carts’ screens will be able to help customers navigate grocery stores, complete shopping lists and make product suggestions for recipes. The Smart Cart is already equipped with multiple high-resolution cameras. Sobeys says those cameras — in conjunction with the cart’s sensitive scale — will eventually make it possible for customers to toss items into their cart without having to enter information or scan bar codes at all. Lacoursiere told the CBC that the new technology is not being introduced to replace human workers, a promise many grocery chains have made in recent months as new innovations arrive. “We’re actually able to free up some employees … to be on the floor answering customers’ questions, talking about the food, helping them choose a recipe or a product,” he said. “It’s not about cutting.” Early customer reviews have been positive, according to the CBC. “It’s better than the self-checkout,” Stuart Eddy told the outlet after adding a bag of bulk almonds to his smart cart full of groceries. “It’s fantastic.” MORE READING: Amazon’s autonomous robots have started delivering packages in a new location: Southern California Domino’s will start delivering pizzas via an autonomous robot this fall Istanbul’s new airport is one of the world’s largest.

Peter Holley,"During a recent episode of NBC’s “Songland” — a primetime show featuring aspiring songwriters who compete to create hit songs — viewers were treated to a new form of high-tech advertising. Midway through the episode, Ryan Tedder, a Grammy Award-winning singer and producer featured as a judge on the show, tinkered with an eye-catching, illuminated keyboard called Lumi. As Tedder played the instrument, a QR code casually appeared at the bottom of the screen with instructions that read more like commands than suggestions: “Open Camera, Scan Code, Shop Now.” In the minutes after the code appeared, NBCUniversal executives say, thousands of viewers did exactly that, using their smartphones to link directly to a website where Lumi was available for purchase. To get there, they didn’t have to download an app, call a shopping network in a limited timeframe or embark on an online hunt. And that, executives say, was precisely the point. “The Holy Grail has always been you seeing a person on TV talking about a product or wearing a product and being able to buy that product right now,” said Josh Feldman, NBCUniversal’s executive vice president in charge of marketing and advertising creative partnerships. “In the past there’s been friction. You have to leave your screen and go to the Internet and search for that product.” “Nobody has ever done this before in television,” Feldman added. “It’s real time results and we can do this across the entire NBC portfolio.” The Weather Channel’s viral demo shows ‘worst-case scenario’ of storm surge The name for this new fusion of entertainment and mobile commerce is readily comprehensible, and purposefully so: “ShoppableTV.” It’s the latest attempt, among many, to add interactivity to what is essentially a passive medium, and it arrives as traditional television scrambles to adapt to new pressures. Not only are audiences inundated by various streams of content, they’ve grown increasingly accustomed to navigating an entertainment landscape using their smartphones and without commercial interruption thanks to on-demand services like Netflix and HBO. In response, NBC executives are attempting to camouflage advertising inside televised content, pairing advertisers and audiences in a way that feels organic and doesn’t prompt people to change the channel. ShoppableTV’s QR codes don’t demand attention for long stretches. They appear on screen for about 30 seconds, enough time, executives believe, for viewers to unlock their smartphones and point a camera at the screen. Though ShoppableTV is in its infancy, NBC says its already been rolled out on several occasions beyond Songland. During the French Open this summer, a code allowed television viewers to purchase clothing from Lacoste’s Novak Djokovic Collection during matches featuring the Serbian tennis star –– an event that the network labeled a “first ever live shoppable event.” “You can purchase what Novak is wearing on the court,” an announcer said during the sports broadcast, barely concealing his own surprise. “Show up at your grocery store with that exact same outfit.” On NBC’s TODAY, a QR code linked viewers to Walmart and during the Tour de France viewers were able to purchase Zwift, a virtual training program for running and cycling. The Today segment, which included encouragement from host Savannah Guthrie and contributor Jill Martin, resulted in about 50,000 QR code scans in five minutes, NBCUniversal said. In addition to tracking the number of code scans, NBCUniversal can track their viewer’s particular purchases, providing the network with a portion of sales revenue generated by the ads. NBCUniversal said it doesn’t retain any other customer data, such as which shows individual customers watch and shop on. The company declined to provide specific sales figures from previous ShoppableTV moments, but said the conversion rate –– the number of website visitors who make a purchase –– was 30 percent higher than the e-commerce average. Merging content with shopping is already commonplace online. Instagram and Facebook both allow users to place shopping tags on posts and stories that direct their audience to a product description page and then directly to a website. Interactive television –– also known as “two-way TV” –– is hardly a novel concept either. Even older, experts say, is the idea that what viewers see on their television screens can be purchased in the real world. “As early as 1944, Macy’s brought this concept to television, scheduling Tele-Shopping with Martha Manning (later renamed Macy’s Teleshopping) on DuMont’s WABD New York,” Lee McGuigan, a PHD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania writes in his 2018 paper , “ Selling Jennifer Aniston’s Sweater: The Persistence of Shoppability in Framing Television’s Future.” “Over the next two years, Gimbels in Philadelphia and Kaufmann’s in Pittsburgh commissioned short television productions, for in-store exhibition, to showcase merchandise such as women’s apparel,” McGuigan adds. Veterans of the 1970s television may remember what was at the time a daring experiment known as Qube . Launched in Columbus, OH., the cable television network allowed subscribers to interact with programs via multiple choice questions and polls that were administered via oversized remote controls of such heft they resembled a book several hundred pages thick. In his 1995 book, The Road Ahead , Microsoft founder Bill Gates, predicted that interactive television would be one entry-point, among several, into the world of commerce, according to a blistering New York Times review at the time . A few years later, an awkward, hand-held barcode named CueCat emerged. Like a complicated QR code before its time, the device allowed users to open webpages by scanning barcodes placed in ads that had been published in magazines and newspapers. The company that created the product, Digital Convergence Corporation, went belly up a year later. Don’t count the old networks out yet. Their fall shows aren’t bad, and their potential audience is huge. Josh Bernoff , a media analyst who has studied efforts to turn television into a storefront, has written that ShoppableTV is CueCat “all over again.” He estimates that ShoppableTV is among the fifth wave of attempts to create interactive television. Among the industry, he said, the aspirational idea has for decades been accompanied by it’s own figurative phrase: “Buying Jennifer Anniston’s sweater,” an achievement that, if attained, would represent the pinnacle of merging commerce and popular televised content. For that reason, he said, the goal has long enthralled television execs. But selling Anniston’s sweater to audiences as it appears on screen has proved an elusive goal. And like all efforts that have come before, he said, the latest wave is also doomed to failure. “It’s a bad idea that continues to come around again and again,” Bernoff said. Despite new advances in technology and complex digital marketing strategies, the reason, Bernoff said, is so glaringly obvious it’s easily missed. “If you look at the history of television and how people interact with it, there’s been huge advances in the level of quality and huge advances in convenience –– things like streaming video on demand. But getting people to interact with what’s on their television has always been difficult.” “People are just generally not in the mood for shopping while they’re watching TV,” he added. But NBC executives would appear to disagree and say they are “doubling down” on investments in new technology to bring mobile, commerce and TV together. Unlike the past, they say consumers have an “all screen mentality,” a nod to the idea that people increasingly expect their devices to be synchronized. “Everybody that you know is watching TV with their mobile device in their hand or directly next to them,” Feldman said. “When we talk about a product on ‘The Today Show’ we know people will immediately do searches and buy that product. We hear that from marketers all the time.” Research shows that audiences overwhelmingly prefer innovative ads over traditional ads and are 85 percent more likely to remember the brand, he added. For now, he noted, the network is not including ShoppableTV in scripted shows and is concentrating instead on live events and unscripted cable programming. Among the network’s unscripted lineup are shows like “Top Chef”, “Project Runway” and “The Voice.” NBC is also confident it can tailor advertising to niche demographics. Between two broadcast networks and 10 cable networks, Feldman said NBCUniversal reaches 90 percent of the U.S. audience each month. “Our legacy television business has been built off hundreds of the same advertisers,” Feldman said. “This now allows non-national television advertising brands to come and partner with us, integrate into shows and sell directly to audiences.” MORE READING: Tired of long lines?

Peter Holley,"Multiple factors often align to make California wildfires unusually hard to contain: hurricane-force winds that sweep toward the coastline, steep and often rough terrain, drought conditions exacerbated by climate change and finite resources spread thin by a vast landscape covered in wilderness. As if that weren’t bad enough, many wildfires are fueled by another accelerant, something that almost ensures destruction on a mass scale: time. California has 33 million acres of forest , far too much land for state agencies to monitor simultaneously. By the time reports of fires reach authorities and resources are mobilized, many hours, and sometimes days, can pass. New radar allows scientists to peer inside California wildfires like never before A San Francisco-based technology company called Chooch AI is trying to narrow that gap with the help of artificial intelligence, reducing the time between a fire’s eruption and the moment it’s spotted by people. The company, which is working with state agencies, researchers and technologists, is working to develop an AI tool that would scour hyper-detailed imagery from satellites for evidence of wildfires largely invisible to the naked eye. If successfully refined, experts believe, the tool could lead to earlier wildfire detection that would almost certainly save more people and property from destruction. Using the same imagery, the AI could be used to identify vegetation that is dangerously close to power lines and locate spots where fires are likely to erupt. The more specific goal, according to chief executive Emrah Gultekin, is an ambitious one: monitoring every acre of forest in California every 10 minutes, alerting authorities almost immediately when a problem arises. He believes the AI may be operational as early as next fire season, which traditionally occurs in the fall, after the state’s brush land has been dried out by months of summer heat. PG&E’s role in Sonoma fire questioned as power outage frustrations grow “If there’s a small brush fire, you want to get there as fast as possible,” Gultekin said. “Oftentimes, it’s out of control by the time people realize there’s a fire and firefighters can be dispatched to the area, which is often hard to reach. “Ultimately, we want to stop these fires from happening entirely,” he added, noting that early damage estimates from fires tearing through California in recent weeks have already exceeded $25 billion . “It’s a huge loss to the economy and a huge loss to human life and wildlife, and it’s seriously costing families. There’s a lot of suffering going on."" Even today, with satellites taking detailed pictures of Earth multiple times a day, most fires are reported by people on the ground or in planes overhead. To locate fires, Chooch AI is training its AI to rely on infrared technology to identify heat and smoke, the latter of which can be pinpointed on an acre-by-acre basis. For a hypothetical comparison, Gultekin estimated that you would need thousands of people to pore over millions of acres of rural land with a similar degree of precision. By tracking traffic patterns and camp fires, the AI can also identify where people have massed on the ground, creating a higher risk for wildfires. The overwhelming majority of wildfires — about 85 percent, according to some estimates — are caused by humans, experts say. When the power went out during California’s wildfires, the air quality monitors turned off, too Gultekin said Chooch AI’s system is similar to models that are being used to pilot autonomous vehicles and operate facial-recognition technology at airports. Unlike similar systems, he said, Chooch AI has no plan to profit off the technology. “The good thing about this AI is that it’s agnostic to the weather conditions,” Gultekin noted. “The AI can see through clouds, and it can see through smoke, so it sees everything.” So far, the company’s main obstacles have not revolved around training its AI but, instead, getting access to useful satellite imagery. Because high-resolution satellites provide data every 12 hours, Chooch AI’s team is training its AI to interpret lower-resolution imagery — known as geostationary satellite imagery — which is updated more frequently. Nirav Patel, a geospatial data scientist and an AI expert with California’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) who has been in touch with Chooch AI, said he believes the tool, when finished, has the potential to benefit firefighters on the ground. Patel is also a noncommissioned officer with California’s Air National Guard and was part of recent efforts to extinguish the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County. Patel said he has seen how unpredictable raging fires can become when early warnings fail. Firefighters had a secret weapon when Notre Dame caught fire: A robot named ‘Colossus’ “That first six to 18 hours is critical to understand how the fire is moving so people can determine what physical or man-made obstacles can be placed in its path,” he said, noting that a satellite-based AI platform could be used alongside planes outfitted with sophisticated sensors and human assets on the ground, such as fire lookouts . There are other efforts to harness the power of AI to combat wildfires. Last year, James MacKinnon, a NASA computer engineer, told Fast Company he had developed an algorithm that could quickly process imagery from onboard satellites, a much faster process than sending images to Earth to be processed by a supercomputer. MacKinnon said his algorithm recognized fires with 98 percent accuracy. “The fires stick out like a sore thumb,” he told the publication. As wildfires ravage California, Patel said DIU is interested in partnering with companies that can offer solutions but want to maintain their intellectual property. To encourage commercial companies such as Chooch AI to develop innovative methods for combating natural disasters such as wildfires and doing damage assessments, DIU has created a competition for members the AI community called the xView2 Challenge . When governments are faced with crises, whether war or natural disasters, those challenges often produce technological innovation. Gultekin, whose company is participating in the xView2 Challenge, said California’s wildfires are no different, particularly when it comes to AI. “Five or 10 years ago, no way we could’ve used AI to interpret satellite data in a meaningful way,” he said. “Right now, maybe we can. We’re working on it, and lots of other companies are, as well. Expect a boom in this type of technology over the next five years.” Read More: Could this tiny tool help thousands when Hurricane Irma hits Florida?

Peter Holley,"As interest in religion wanes around the world, and secularism surges , religious leaders have begun searching for innovative ways to spread their message and connect with potential adherents. In the United States, some churches  have relaxed dress codes, revamped worship spaces and churned out sermons that place less emphasis on sin, all while embracing Instagram and refashioning faith as a lifestyle brand . In Japan — where low fertility rates and an aging population are reducing religious affiliation — Buddhist priests have been warning for more than a decade that their ancient tradition risks extinction. To reverse course, a Kyoto temple has settled on a new plan for connecting with the masses, one that channels ancient wisdom through the technology of the future. Its name is “Mindar,” a mostly aluminum androgynous robotic priest who gives plain-spoken sermons that are designed to stimulate interest in Buddhist teachings, according to the machine’s designers. Standing more than 6 feet tall and weighing nearly 70 pounds, Mindar preaches inside Kodaiji temple, a 400-year-old temple. Although the robot preaches, it is not programmed to converse with worshipers, though its sermons are translated to English and Chinese on a nearby wall, creators say. The machine is not equipped with machine-learning algorithms, but the robot’s designers said there may come a day when artificial intelligence gives the robot some measure of autonomy, adding a strange new dimension to how religious messages are delivered. “If an image of Buddha speaks, teachings of Buddhism will probably be easier to understand,” Tensho Goto, the chief steward of the temple in Kyoto’s Higashiyama Ward, said during a recent news conference, according to the Japan Times . “We want people to see the robot and think about the essence of Buddhism.” Japanese researchers want to give your grandma a robotic monkey tail The robot was created by a team led by Hiroshi Ishiguro, a renown roboticist and professor of intelligent robotics at Osaka University . Reached by email, Kohei Ogawa, an associate professor at Osaka University who helped design Mindar, said researchers’ goal was to redesign a Buddhist statue using modern robotics technology. The result was a $1 million collaboration between the temple and Osaka University in which researchers decided Mindar should channel Kannon Bodhisattva, the Buddhist deity of mercy. The machine is able to move its torso, arms and head, which is covered in a pasty silicone that resembles lifelike human skin, according to Agence France-Presse . With wires and blinking lights spilling from the top of its half-opened cranium, Mindar bears some resemblance to a Terminator-like villain or the android from Bjork’s “All is Full of Love” video . Adding to this potentially unsettling aesthetic, the robot’s left eye includes a tiny video camera, AFP reports. The article notes that Mindar’s words are full of ominous warnings lifted from Buddhist teachings. “You cling to a sense of selfish ego,” the machine says in a voice that sounds like it belongs to a woman or child. “Worldly desires are nothing other than a mind lost at sea.” In its current form, Ogawa said, Mindar is “new media” conveying religious information — not an artificially intelligent machine. But, he said, there are already plans for the robot to evolve, raising important questions for researchers and monks that he labeled “sensitive” in nature. “In the next step, we are planning to create an autonomous function,” Ogawa said. “We are going to tackle more fundamental issues, such as, what happens if a Buddhist statue starts talking?"" “How do we define the intelligence of a Buddhist statue?” he added. “And how do people resolve the gaps between Mindar and Buddhist teachings, which are in their mind?” Mindar is not the only Buddhism-spouting robot on display in Japan. For several years now, a doe-eyed humanoid robot named “Pepper” has been available for hire at Japanese funerals, where it chants sutras and taps a drum in the tradition of a Buddhist priest, according to World-Wide Religious News . Worshipers’ reactions to Mindar vary, with some reporting in a recent survey that the machine exuded an unexpected warmth and easy-to-follow teachings and others insisting the robot felt too contrived, if not creepy, according to AFP. Goto told the news outlet that people’s reactions appear to be influenced by their cultural background, with Western visitors being more disturbed by the robot than Japanese worshipers, who come from a culture that has embraced robots. “It could be the influence of the Bible, but Westerners have compared it to Frankenstein’s monster,” Goto said. Goto said the Buddhist deity on which the machine is based is not limited to a single form, meaning an artificially intelligent machine may be just as capable as anything of delivering messages about the Buddha’s path. Unlike a human priest who exists inside the impermanent vessel that is the human form, Mindar has a distinct advantage. “This robot will never die, it will just keep updating itself and evolving,” Goto told AFP. “That’s the beauty of a robot. It can store knowledge forever and limitlessly."" “With AI, we hope it will grow in wisdom to help people overcome even the most difficult troubles. It’s changing Buddhism,” he added.

Peter Holley,"Last year, after placing an order for Tesla’s recently unveiled Model 3, Amie Dansby began to ponder an ambitious idea. Because of its many high tech features, she knew the car was regularly compared to a computer on wheels. Dansby — a software engineer from Dallas — wondered whether it might be possible to control that mobile computer the way a growing number of people are controlling other devices, opening doors, turning on lights and retrieving food from vending machines: with a microchip implanted in her body. Some people laughed when the 34-year-old software engineer detailed her dream, and others told her it was impossible, a sentiment, she said, that only strengthened her resolve. “I realized that nobody had ever done it with a Tesla, and that made it so much more of a challenge that I wanted to overcome,” said Dansby, who began formulating a plan about a year ago. “But it’s one of those things that’s so new there’s nothing on Google to help you.” They put microchips in their employees. Now this company is helping parents track their children. To the uninitiated, Dansby’s desire to control her surroundings with an implanted microchip might sound like it was plucked from some dystopian future. But as The Washington Post’s Danielle Paquette noted last year , microchips aren’t exactly new and have been used to tag “pets and livestock” and track deliveries. A growing number of companies and people are also opting to outfit their bodies with technology that monitors their health, controls nearby electronic devices or even lights up when activated for aesthetic purposes. Biohax International , a Swedish company, has implanted its microchip in several thousand customers, allowing them to ride trains without using tickets, turn on the lights in their apartments and access a gym the company has partnered with. The company claims the microchips are used only to enhance systems that are “completely under your control.” Proponents of medical microchips point out that the devices could contain someone’s entire medical history. If a patient were unconscious or suffering from memory loss, for example, those records could prove invaluable for emergency-room doctors who might be unfamiliar with the person’s prescribed medications or history of illness. Critics say the practice raises serious privacy concerns, especially when considering who would be responsible for the mountains of personal data that microchips are capable of producing about an individual’s movement, behaviors and health. This firm already microchips employees. Could your ailing relative be next? When she decided that she wanted to place a chip in her arm that would allow her to control her Tesla, Dansby already had an RFID implant in her left hand that gives her basic access to her personal computer and lets her open her front door. (An RFID chip is a chip that uses radio frequency signals to exchange information.) Dansby initially considered syncing that chip to her Tesla as well, but eventually realized controlling the car meant she’d have to place a separate chip in her opposite arm. After a series of tests, she decided to remove the chip in her Tesla key card, a credit card-like piece of plastic that allows vehicle owners to access and start their car . To do this, she dissolved the key card in acetone until the plastic casing disappeared, leaving the chip. Dansby had the chip encased in a biopolymer, a natural material that can safely remain under her skin like the silicon that is used for breast implants. That, she said, is when the hard part really began. “The longest part of this whole process was emailing doctors who didn’t want to risk losing their medical license,” Dansby said, noting she’d entered talks with three doctors, all of whom eventually backed out. After six months of searching, Dansby turned to a tattoo shop that specializes in body modifications, where a professional piercer inserted the implant into her right arm just beneath her wrist through a hollow needle (video of the slightly bloody implantation process can be viewed here ). A few days later, after her arm had healed, Dansby was able to unlock and start her car with a wave of her arm. Her appendage has to be just a few inches from the vehicle for the chip to be effective because its range is limited. The entire process, including research, she said, took about a year. “People think chips in your body are weird, but we think Botox and breast augmentation or Lasik are normal — and those are all body modifications,” she said. “Imagine how it must have felt to be one of the first people who decided to put two silicon implants in their chest and now it’s so completely forgettable.” A video Dansby made documenting her experience has racked up nearly 300,000 views.

Peter Holley,"When Andrew Kaplan reminisces, his engrossing tales leave the impression that he’s managed to pack multiple lives into a single existence: globe-trotting war correspondent in his 20s, a member of the Israeli army who fought in the Six-Day War, successful entrepreneur and, later, the author of numerous spy novels and Hollywood scripts. Now — as the silver-haired 78-year-old unwinds with his wife of 39 years in a suburban oasis outside Palm Springs — he has realized he would like his loved ones to have access to those stories, even when he’s no longer alive to share them. Kaplan has agreed to become “AndyBot,” a virtual person who will be immortalized in the cloud for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years. If all goes according to plan, future generations will be able to interact with him using mobile devices or voice computing platforms such as Amazon’s Alexa, asking him questions, eliciting stories and drawing upon a lifetime’s worth of advice long after his physical body is gone. Someday, Kaplan — who playfully refers to himself as a “guinea pig” — may be remembered as one of the world’s first “digital humans.” “Being a pioneer at my age is kind of unexpected,” he said, “but I figured, why the hell not?” Wearable technology started by tracking steps. Soon, it may allow your boss to track your performance. For decades, Silicon Valley futurists have sought to unchain humanity from the corporeal life cycle, viewing death as yet another transformational problem in need of a “life altering” solution. What began with the cryonics movement, in which bodies are frozen for future resuscitation, has intensified amid the rise of digital culture. Today, a new generation of companies is hawking some approximation of virtual immortality –– the opportunity to preserve one’s legacy online forever. On its website, Eternime claims that more than 44,000 people have already signed up to partake in its “big hairy audacious goal” — turning the “memories, ideas, creations and stories of billions of people” into intelligent avatars that look like them and live on indefinitely. Nectome, a research company specializing in memory preservation, hopes their high-tech brain embalming process will someday allow our minds to be reanimated as a computerized simulation. HereAfter , an allusion to the future as well as the eternal, is the startup that Kaplan has embraced, eager to become one of the world’s first virtual residents, partly because he considers the effort a way to extend intimate family bonds over multiple generations. The company’s motto — “Never lose someone you love” — reflects Kaplan’s reasons for signing up. “My parents have been gone for decades, and I still catch myself thinking, ‘Gee, I would really like to ask my mom or dad for some advice or just to get some comfort,’ ” he said. “I don’t think the urge ever goes away.” “I have a son in his 30s, and I’m hoping this will be of some value to him and his children someday,” he added. The rituals surrounding death may be as diverse as the cultures they spring from, but for decades now, many of us have followed a similar script after loved ones depart: We pore over old family photo albums, watch grainy home movies, plaster their faces on T-shirts — or even memorialize their Facebook page, preserving their digital quintessence online. But futurists say that script may be on the verge of a rewrite. If technology succeeds in creating emotionally intelligent digital humans, experts say, it may forever change the way living people cooperate with computers and experience loss. “AndyBot” may become one of the world’s first meaningful examples, raising complex philosophical questions about the nature of immortality and the purpose of existence itself. HereAfter was co-founded by Sonia Talati, who calls herself a personal legacy consultant, and James Vlahos, a California journalist and conversational-AI designer who is best known for creating a software program called the Dadbot. Brought to life after Vlahos learned that his father was dying of cancer, the Dadbot allows him to exchange text and audio messages with a computerized avatar of his late father, conversing about his life as well as hearing songs, small talk and jokes. Once the Dadbot became widely known, Vlahos received so many requests to create memorializing bots for other people that he decided an untapped market for making virtual people was primed for the mainstream. “It took my mom two years to remove the answering-machine message with my dad’s voice from their home phone,” Vlahos said. “She didn’t want to extinguish his voice, and that’s something I’ve heard from other people. But it’s almost comical that we’re still relying on such a primitive method to hear the voices of our loved ones after they’re gone.” The latest YouTube craze? Videos that show you what it’s like to live in prison. Instead of merely hearing a recording, Vlahos is building a more sophisticated and user-friendly virtual model that is being designed to encourage interaction. It will probably begin with an app that captures someone’s oral history through prompted questions. After your grandmother has answered a litany of questions about her childhood, marriage and significant life events, for example, her voice will be converted into an audio bot that will be accessible through a smartphone or virtual assistant. Because these devices increasingly function like communal computers in hundreds of millions of kitchens and living rooms, and their usage rates are rising, Vlahos believes they lend themselves to the sort of casual interaction with a deceased relative that many people crave. Like Netflix or Blue Apron, the company will use a subscription model, one that allows users to interact with a relative’s bot for a monthly fee. With proper consent, nonrelatives can also purchase a subscription to a bot. Vlahos said he considers the service an “interactive memoir” and expects it will be especially appealing to customers between the ages of 30 and 50 who want to preserve their parents’ history — and essence — before it’s too late. The company is developing virtual profiles for customers and expects to unveil its public app over the next year. “Audio recordings tend to languish on your hard drive,” Vlahos said, “and when in your daily life do you really have time to sit down and watch eight hours of video recordings from Christmas of ‘83? “Now imagine being able to stand in the kitchen and call out to your deceased mother and have her answer right back,” he said. “There’s just something about being able to hear our loved ones’ voices.” The Silicon Valley elite’s latest status symbol: Chickens Edward Saatchi, the chief executive of Fable, a company in the process of creating virtual beings, says interacting with digital humans is not only an inevitability but also the next leap forward in how humans interact with technology. “Imagine a future in which Alexa or Siri is a character with a face and a life and a voice that allows you to interact with them one-on-one,” Saatchi said, arguing that virtual beings will eventually replace Android and iOS. “You’ll be able to play games, order food, spend time or learn a language with a virtual being — or do anything else you might normally do with a friend.” Yet, to perfect virtual beings, companies such as Eternime and HereAfter will have to begin chipping away at a problem that has confounded computer scientists for decades — enabling “multi-turn conversations” between humans and machines. Unlike ordering a pizza — simple, short and guided by a specific objective — a multi-turn conversation is free-flowing and spontaneous, drifting among unrelated topics and using the nearly infinite variety of natural language the way conversations between people often do. Vlahos says that the more fluidly his product communicates with users, the more it absorbs the tonality and ticks of the person it is channeling, the more authentic intimacy it conveys. At the same time, knowing that computers are years, if not decades, away from handling back-and-forth conversations as well as people do, he aims for the more realistic short-term goal of enabling legacy bots to share stories about a person’s life on command. David Kessler, author of the upcoming book “ Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief, ” said intimacy could benefit some people grieving the loss of a loved one but might pose a serious problem for others. With grieving clients, Kessler said, the goal is for them to remember the departed with more love than pain. The goal isn’t necessarily for them to relinquish their grief but to integrate their suffering into their lives in a healthy way. Could a dead relative, conversing through a Google Home, aid in that goal? “I think so,” he said. “Grief is as individual as our fingerprint. There will be some people who find this tool comforting and some people who would never use it, because it doesn’t feel like their loved one to them.” His only concern — making sure vulnerable people understand that they’re dealing with “an artificial reminder of Dad, not the continuation of the actual relationship with your father.” As he enters his autumnal years on the golf courses of Southern California, reflecting on a life fully lived, Kaplan — the former globe-trotting journalist turned robot prototype — said he isn’t seeking immortality. However, he does see another benefit to becoming a virtual person, one informed by his many years as a purveyor of compelling fiction. “In the end, every story is about trying to help us find out who we are and where we came from, and this is no different,” he said. “This is about history for me, a kind of limited immortality that creates an intimate personal experience for my future relatives who want to know where they came from.” MORE READING: How quickly can AI solve a Rubik’s Cube?

Peter Holley,"Business schools are packed with courses devoted to high-tech entrepreneurship, financial accounting and academic theories on leadership. Far less common are courses that teach students the “people skills” necessary to put their newly acquired knowledge to use. In the business world, where relationship-building is essential, these “soft” skills — personal confidence, negotiation, active listening, calm and flexibility — can play an outsize role. But they’re often treated like inborn traits, skills more likely to be won in a genetic lottery than cultivated in a classroom. At Fordham University this semester, business professors are challenging this notion with a high-tech teaching tool that is making its way into more and more classrooms: virtual reality. Instead of listening to lectures or poring over textbooks, students enrolled in Fordham’s “Exploring Entrepreneurship” class are donning VR goggles that temporarily remove them from the classroom and place them in simulations designed to build professional skills. The university where student loans can pay for tuition, books — and a virtual reality headset In one simulation, students learn how to network among groups of strangers gathered in a room. In others, they lead negotiations at a high-stakes business meeting in a conference room or give presentations in front of colleagues. While a handful of students are immersed in a simulation, their virtual selves are broadcast on a projector for the rest of the class to watch, and critique, in real time. The students in the VR experience are given new names, genders and voices so that their true identity remains anonymous, which enhances the realism, according to Lyron Bentovim, the professor leading the class alongside professor Christine Janssen. Bentovim is also chief executive of the Glimpse Group , the New York-based AR/VR company behind the technology students are using in class. The Glimpse Group serves as a holding company for several VR and AR start-ups. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he is a passionate VR advocate who believes in its ability to reinvent educational environments. He said students who learn in a simulated environment talk differently than students who are more heavily reliant on textbooks. “Your brain actually assumes you’ve experienced the simulated environment, and it brings educational concepts to life for students,” he said. “When they leave class, they don’t say, ‘We learned about negotiating today’; they say, ‘I negotiated today,’ or, ‘I led a business meeting today.’ “When you have the headset on, it feels real, and that experience creates confidence,” he added. The market for virtual reality applications is growing quickly and will continue to do so as the cost of equipment falls, giving students and schools greater access to technology, according to Meredith Thompson, David Kaser and Kara Grijvala, whose book, “ Envisioning Virtual Reality ,” was published by Carnegie Mellon University’s ETC Press earlier this year. The authors note that VR has particularly promising applications in what they refer to as “low resource settings,” environments with limited educational budgets located in low- and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Citing the work of South African VR expert Dave Lockwood, the authors write that in many low-resource education settings, students may not be learning in their native language and textbooks and materials may not be available in a language in which both teacher and student are proficient. “VR overcomes language as a barrier by turning content visual, leveling the linguistic environment and creating a universal experience,” the authors add. Beyond their in-class VR, the Glimpse Group this week unveiled a new way for Fordham students to experience class from outside the classroom. They call it Project Chimera , an immersive educational broadcast that mixes virtual reality with 180-degree video and real life. With a VR headset strapped on, remote students can sit in on the class in real time as if they are physically present, and even interact with one another, the teacher and local students via a custom avatar. A video made at Fordham University shows students using VR headsets to join a real-world college classroom re-created in the virtual world as the class unfolds in real time. Using the headset, remote students are able to participate with fellow students, take notes and get the attention of the instructor to ask questions. Looking to the future, Bentovim predicts that VR will become, over time, a feature in classrooms at every level of education. More advanced versions of Project Chimera, he said, could even negate the need for a classroom altogether, allowing people to join in an immersive classroom environment together no matter where they individually might be. “VR could change how educational institutions think about budgeting, as well,” he said. “Let’s say you wanted to simulate what it’s like to work as a geologist or teach a class about manufacturing in Japan. Now you can take the whole class to Japan with the click of a button.” California has 33 million acres of forest. This company is training artificial intelligence to scour it all for wildfire. Researchers are already beginning to investigate whether VR offers a meaningful substitute for real-world experiences. A 2016 study concluded that virtual reality can be a successful replacement for lab experiences. European researchers randomly selected 189 students from an undergraduate biology course and had them practice “streaking out bacteria on agar plates in a virtual environment.” The students were later assessed on their ability to perform the same exercise in a real lab. The results showed that there were no significant differences between students who practiced in a virtual environment and those who practiced in a physical lab. “Our data show that vLABs function just as well as face-to-face tutorials in preparing students for a physical lab activity in microbiology,” the study concluded.

Peter Holley,"On paper, Lesley Matheson has only one job, a demanding gig leading a team of software developers at a high-pressure Silicon Valley start-up. In reality, the 49-year-old single mother has another full-time job that can be even more consuming: managing her three children’s busy schedules, a never-ending and continually fluctuating snarl of trips to and from school, water polo and taekwondo practices, French horn lessons, and last-minute errands. In the past, Matheson has relied on part-time nannies to help her carry the load, racking up hundreds of dollars a week for them to ferry her children around the Bay Area. More recently, she said, she has offloaded much of that burden on a ride-hailing company for kids called Zum. Matheson said the company has helped her ease the burden created by her children’s schedules. In turn, she said, Zum has offered her the ability to focus even more of her energy on her career. “As a woman, you tend to pick everything up and be in charge of everyone’s logistics, which helps your family, but it can also take a massive toll on your own life,” she said. “You can’t imagine how many meetings there are in start-ups where everyone else in the room is male, and I’m typically the only one worrying about the logistics of my kids while I’m also trying to do my work.” Uber, but for football practice: A kid-only ride-hailing service is coming to D.C. Zum isn’t just a way for parents to outsource portions of their hectic lives. In addition to it being available to families such as the Mathesons, Zum has partnered with dozens of California school districts in recent years and is available to students at 2,000 schools in the Bay Area and in Los Angeles, many of which still rely on yellow school buses, the company says. On Thursday, Zum — which is accessible to parents through a mobile app and claims it has already completed 1 million rides — announced it is expanding to a half dozen other cities around the country, including San Diego, Miami, Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago and the D.C. area. Rides will begin in those locations next month. In the District, Zum will compete with HopSkipDrive, a ride-hailing service founded by three working mothers in Los Angeles for children ages 6 to 18 that arrived on the East Coast earlier this year. In Dallas, Zum will compete with Bubbl , a ride service staffed by off-duty police officers and first responders, one of many small transportation companies that have popped up around the country in recent years seeking to fill a similar niche. For much of the past century, generations of children have walked from their homes to bus stops each morning, embarking on a commute that is synonymous with both public education and adolescence. Beyond providing fodder for unknown numbers of television shows and iconic movies over the years, school buses have also played a prominent, and still controversial , role in America’s efforts to desegregate. They have also been precarious environments beset by drug use, bullying, fighting and sexual activity — a “Lord of the Flies”-like island on wheels where the law of the jungle too often prevails. Companies such as Zum, GoKart, Kango, Bubbl and HopSkipDrive — all of which are competing to become the next “Uber for kids” — are pitching themselves as the 21st-century alternative. If widely adopted, they maintain, their model could usher in a new era of safer, greener and more data-rich transportation for students that can be tracked by parents in real time. For now, with ride-hailing for students still in its early stages and gradually gaining momentum, many districts offering Zum are using it to transport small numbers of students in conjunction with traditional bus routes. Many other students, school officials say, still rely on their parents for rides or have access to their own vehicles. Shuddle, a ride-share start-up that shut down in 2016 after two years of operation and after raising more than $10 million, reveals that the room for error remains small. Even so, investors believe Zum has potential for growth. In February, Zum raised $44 million in a Series C funding round led by BMW i Ventures. It was joined by Spark Capital, Sequoia Capital and Volvo Cars Tech Fund, bringing the company’s total funding to $71 million. Investors know that ride-hailing has already been widely adopted by young people, but with a serious caveat that could play into Zum’s favor. Unaccompanied minors are prohibited from using services such as Uber and Lyft, though experts warn it can be difficult to verify a rider’s age. Data from a teen debit card company reveals that “ride-sharing services combined to capture 84 percent of teen spending on taxi services.” Despite age restrictions, some teenagers use drivers with specialized insurance that allows them to drive younger passengers, the study notes. Unlike Uber or Lyft, Zum rides are booked the day before, and the service is not designed to be on-demand. Both Uber and Lyft have been plagued by reports of criminal drivers and demands for more rigorous background checks , leaving many parents with serious concerns about their children using either service. Zum claims its drivers have three years or more of child-care experience. They undergo background checks and SafeSchools training courses, and the company claims its safety protocols are reviewed by KidsAndCars.org , a national nonprofit child safety organization. The firm says its business model is fundamentally dependent on its ability to keep students safe. Janette Fennell, president of KidsAndCars.org , said the two organizations have also worked together to create best practices for driver training. “We wanted to make sure students were transported correctly — in the back seat,” Fennell said. “We also put a big emphasis on making sure children are never left alone in the vehicle because that’s very dangerous. There’s a lot of thought that goes into each pickup and drop-off.” School buses are typically funded by state education budgets with taxpayer dollars, the same money being used by districts to pay for Zum, according to the company. When used by families outside of school, Zum starts at $10 for carpool rides (per child for a one-way trip) and $19.50 for a single (non-carpool) ride. Like Uber or Lyft, the company says, prices vary depending on location and time of day. At about $20 a ride, HopSkipDrive is also more expensive than alternatives such as Uber and Lyft, but it also offers carpooling options that lower prices. Matheson admitted that the ride-hailing service is sometimes pricey, with longer rides costing as much as $30 apiece. However, that’s still less expensive than a part-time nanny. The company claims that, on average, kids who use the service in California take 10 Zum rides a month. “I have friends using the service for their kids two, three times a day,” Matheson said. Uber is working to win you back. (But it also needs you to pay more.) Ritu Narayan, co-founder and chief executive of Zum, said the idea for the company came from her own experience as a mother juggling her children’s schedules, a challenge that began to affect her career. “Each day, I was always on the edge of leaving my job to deal with a family issue,” said Narayan, who was working at eBay at the time. “I saw similar problems among the parents around me.” In hopes of injecting flexibility into tightly packed family schedules, Narayan settled on creating a door-to-door ride-hailing service for kids. As she refined her idea, she said, it became clear that the established methods for moving children between their homes and schools were in desperate need of a modern upgrade. “We’re stuck in an infrastructure that is 70 years old, and the yellow buses that districts rely on are only used 20 percent of the time,” she said, noting that busing is a $50 billion industry. “Schools find it very hard to replace drivers who quit or are fired, and children end up spending enormous amounts of time on the buses, which impacts their performance in the classroom. “The current system is not personalized or flexible, and it doesn’t extend to after-school arrangements,” she added. Using Zum, schools can pick which children travel together, and parents receive notifications informing them of a driver’s precise arrival time instead of having children linger at bus stops. Zum says the company also provides schools with a technology platform that allows school officials to optimize transportation routes and monitor vehicles on those routes in real time. The result of using smaller and more efficient vehicles, according to Zum, is lower transportation costs and reduced administrative hassle. Grace Garner, chief business officer with the Garvey School District in Rosemead, Calif., a city in the San Gabriel Valley just east of Los Angeles, said her district saved more than half a million dollars in the first year of switching from buses to Zum, with many special education students reducing their commute times from more than 45 minutes to less than 15. Report: UCLA students use Lyft and Uber to get to class, and it’s raising environmental concerns Paula Wessels, assistant to the chief of student support services for the Los Gatos-Saratoga Union High School District outside San Jose, said her district has cut its transportation costs by just under half since partnering with Zum. Now in the third year of the partnership, she said, the district has completely phased out traditional buses. Wessels said school districts are evolving to keep up with the evolving expectations of parents, whose own lifestyles are being changed by ride-hailing, smartphones and more sophisticated delivery options. “Parents have always wanted their students to get to school safely — that hasn’t changed,” said Wessels, who personally tracks about 40 students who rely on Zum to get to and from school each day. “What has changed is that parents can track their students’ rides on their phone and it gives them peace of mind, and students can give them feedback about whether they were pleased with the driver. It really is a personal service.” MORE READING: This Tesla owner wanted to control her Model 3. So she implanted a valet key in her arm.
